Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub.:  Disclosure pursuant to Regulation 30 of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
 
Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI Listing Regulations, we would like to inform that 
Mumbai International Airport Limited (‘MIAL’), stepdown subsidiary of Adani Enterprises 
Limited (‘Company’) had invoked arbitration against Airports Authority of India (“AAI”) 
seeking certain reliefs as eligible to it on account of the occurrence of Force Majeure 
event (Covid-19 period) under the Operation, Management and Development 
Agreement dated 4th April 2006 (“ OMDA”). 
 
The Arbitral Tribunal has pronounced the Award on 6th January 2024, the key aspects 
of the Award being the following:    
 
 MIAL is excused from making payment of Monthly Annual Fee (“ MAF”) for the period 
from 13th March 2020 to 28th February 2022 due to existence of force majeure. 
Accordingly, the amount of MAF paid by MIAL to AAI for the period 13th March 2020 
to 28th February 2022 is ordered to be refunded along with interest.  
 There shall be extension of the term of OMDA for the period which is equivalent to 
period from 13th March, 2020 to 28th February, 2022.  
 
The award may be challenged by AAI within 3 months, in which case MIAL will 
appropriately defend the matter.  
 
This is for your information and records. 
 
Thanking you, 
 
Yours faithfully, 
For Adani Enterprises Limited
