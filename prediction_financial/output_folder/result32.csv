MARUTI,Maruti Suzuki India Limited,News Clarification,"The Exchange had sought clarification from Maruti Suzuki India Limited with respect to a news item captioned ""MFs dig in for fight on Maruti's Gujarat plant"". The Company has clarified that ""We have already informed the Stock Exchanges in March-14 that the Board has approved that a 100% Suzuki subsidiary should make the investment in establishing new manufacturing facilities in Gujarat. The details of the Company, and how the investment would be financed were also made public. The Suzuki subsidiary would enter into an exclusive contract for manufacturing cars for MSIL and that in accordance with Section 188 of the New Company s Act, we will be putting up this proposal for shareholder voting. In pursuance of this voting, on June 06, 2014, we put up a presentation, meant for investors, highlighting the salient features of the proposed contract manufacturing arrangement in the public domain through the stock exchanges and the Company s Website. The benefits of the arrangement to MSIL were highlighted in this presentation. Subsequent to this, we met our institutional shareholders and proxy advisory firms and explained the merits of the proposed arrangement for Gujarat and answered their questions, and gave clarifications. No further information was shared and there has been no event / negotiation as referred in your email / the Business Standard article. It is also pertinent to clarify that the article in Business Standard mentions some points which are factually incorrect. For instance, the article states The Company has, however, maintained the move will only result in reducing the cost of manufacturing its cars . The fact is the Company has never stated this at all. What the Company has stated is that this arrangement will result in our making the same profit as we would have made if we had invested our money, with an additional treasury income arising from our not having to invest our money. This would mean higher returns on investment as compared to the option of the Company investing its own funds in Gujarat capacity. There is also a mention in the Business Standard article of the company ""...get (ting) into distribution instead of the complete value chain . A Car company to be successful has to carry out several functions like R&D, product development, sourcing, manufacturing, sales, service and supply of after-market parts. Manufacturing alone cannot ensure the success of a car company in the market as can be seen from the market shares in India of some car manufacturing giants of the world. For most of these companies, a limited sales and service network has been the most decisive factor for their market position. Also, there is no car company in the world to our knowledge that does the complete value chain itself. On the contrary most car companies in the world and India have a high level of outsourcing of manufacturing; generally three-fourths of the car by value is outsourced"".",27-Oct-2014 12:58:00,2014-10-27 12:58:00,-,-,-,27-10-2014,3171.0,3190.0,3105.5,3169.699951171875,2935.394775390625,160160,0.0,0.0,03-11-2014,0
