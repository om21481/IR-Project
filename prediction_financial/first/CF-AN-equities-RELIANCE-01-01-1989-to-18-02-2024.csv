This Writ Petition is pending before single judge of Delhi High Court with a direction that no coercive steps shall be taken by ACB. 3. A Division Bench of Delhi High Court vide its judgment dated 4 August 2016, has held that ACB of NCT of Delhi does not have jurisdiction to investigate charges against Central Government employees. The Delhi Government has filed a Special Leave Petition (ￂﾓSLPￂﾔ) before the Supreme Court which is being heard by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court. 4. In view of the judgment of Division Bench of the Delhi High Court defining the jurisdiction of ACB, RIL filed for an application to expedite the hearing of RIL Writ Petition and stay of investigation by ACB. The said applications were listed for hearing before Mr Justice AK Chawla of Delhi High Court on 22 November 2017. 5. During the hearing on 22 November 2017, the Court observed that since the Constitutional Bench of Supreme Court is already hearing the underlying legal issue, it may be prudent to await decision of the Supreme Court and did not grant a stay of further investigation by ACB. 6.
