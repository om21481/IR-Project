After consolidating the responses received from various banks, PRA has come out with the final Supervisory Statement (SS/ 10/14) on 5th September 2014. In the policy statement, PRA has reiterated what they had mentioned in their Consultation Paper albeit with certain elaborations. As per the same, all new Branches coming in and wanting to undertake any of the Critical Economic Functions (CEFs) like Retail and those impacting systemic stability will have to come as subsidiary. For existing branches, PRA's approach will depend on factors like the nature of activities undertaken by the branch, de-minimis levels prescribed in case of retail banking, equivalence of Home State Supervisor (In our case Reserve Bank of India), acceptability of arrangements for resolution etc. Though SBI UK Operations undertake retail banking activities above the prescribed de-minimis levels, PRA is expected to take a position with regard to each non-EEA (European Economic Area) branch only after evaluating the Home State Supervisory equivalence, resolvability etc. SBI UK Operations will decide on their future banking model (Branch or Subsidiary) on receipt of the final evaluation from PRA. The article is not expected to have any material impact on SBI.""","12-Sep-2014 11:04:00","2014-09-12 11:04:00","-","-","-"
