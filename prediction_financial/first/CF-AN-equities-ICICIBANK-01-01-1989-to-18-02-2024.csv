In order to avoid asymmetry of information and selective disclosure, the Bank is issuing this statement. There was a media report in 2016 which alleged nepotism and conflict of interest on the part of Ms. Chanda Kochhar, the then MD & CEO of ICICI Bank, while sanctioning loans to a corporate group.  The then Chairman of the Board of Directors of ICICI Bank engaged a reputed law firm for conducting an inquiry into the allegations made in such media report. All concerned parties (including the Bank) cooperated with the inquiry and furnished necessary records, documents and statements. The law firm submitted its report in December 2016 stating that it had found no evidence of nepotism and conflict of interest on the part of Ms. Kochhar and accordingly the matter was treated as closed. When further media reports surfaced in March 2018 on the same matter, the Board of Directors, inter alia, basis the inquiry report of the law firm, issued a statement expressing confidence in Ms. Kochhar.   Subsequent to additional whistle-blower allegations and further information made available to the Bank, the Board of Directors determined the need for a fresh inquiry, which was announced on May 30, 2018. Further, the Bank informed the law firm about the said developments, whereupon the law firm expressed that its earlier report would no longer be valid.

ICICI Bank was not the lead bank in this consortium and the Information Memorandum for the loans were prepared by other banks. The Bank did not provide individual facility to any of the five companies mentioned.As part of this programme, the consortium assessed the financials of Videocon Industries Ltd. as well the consolidated financials of the group. The structure enabled the consortium to pool the cash flow of all the obligor companies towards debt servicing.

The 12 associate companies of Videocon Industries were  made ￂﾑco-obligorsￂﾒ of the loan, which meant that they were obligated to pay for the loan in case of default by their group.These ￂﾑchargesￂﾒ were filed with the Registrar of Companies (ROC).

"ICICIBANK","ICICI Bank Limited","Updates","ICICI Bank Limited has informed the Exchange regarding 'Subject: Company UpdateThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed through an order dated March 26, 2018, a monetary penalty of &#8377; 589 million on ICICI Bank Limited (the Bank) for non-compliance with directions issued by RBI on direct sale of securities from its HTM portfolio and specified disclosure in this regard. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Section 46(4)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, taking into account failure of the Bank to adhere to the aforesaid directions/guidelines issued by RBI.With reference to the above, the Bank would like to provide the below clarification:The Bank gives utmost importance to regulatory compliance and ensuring compliance with all directives, guidelines and observations by RBI. RBI guidelines require banks to classify investments into three categories - Held For Trading (HFT), Available For Sale (AFS) and Held to Maturity (HTM). The securities acquired by the banks with the intention to hold them till maturity can be classified under HTM. If the value of sales of securities from HTM category exceeds 5% of the HTM investments, banks are required to disclose in the audited annual financial statements, the market value of the HTM investments and indicate the excess of book value over market value. RBI has imposed a penalty on the Bank for continued sale of government securities classified as HTM. The Bank had continued with the sales from HTM category for a few weeks during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due to a genuine misunderstanding on the timing of the applicability of RBIￂﾒs direction in this matter. As per RBI guidelines, the Bank had disclosed in its annual report for FY2017 that it had sold more than 5% of investments categorised as HTM. However, the Bank had not made the specified additional disclosure at that time. The Bank has subsequently been making the specified disclosure as directed by RBI in the audited financial results since the quarter ended June 30, 2017. During the current year, i.e., FY2018, the Bank has sold less than 5% of securities from its HTM portfolio. The Bank would like to re-iterate that it continues to give utmost importance to regulatory compliance and endeavors to meet supervisory expectations'.","29-Mar-2018 14:49:00","2018-03-29 14:49:00","-","-","https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/corporate/BSE_NSE_29032017_29032018144921_615.zip"
