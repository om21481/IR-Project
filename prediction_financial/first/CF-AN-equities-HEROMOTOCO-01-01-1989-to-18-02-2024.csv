"HEROMOTOCO","Hero MotoCorp Limited","Updates","Hero MotoCorp Limited has informed the Exchange that we wish to submit our response to the query sought by stock exchanges as detailed hereunder: Query: In the press release issued by the Company on May 3, 2018, the sales number for April, 2017 was mentioned as 5,95,706, whereas the number for the said month was reported as 5,91,306 in the press release dated May 1, 2017. Company's Response: The Company commenced the production at its manufacturing facility in Bangladesh in the month of May 2017. Company's exports to Bangladesh therefore, transitioned from April 2017, to different codes in SAP. Since this was the first month of the system transition, the entire process of capturing the total data on Company's Internal SAP System took longer than usual. Therefore, the sales numbers of April 2017 issued to the stock exchanges showed a lesser number than the actual number of vehicles sold during the month. This was rectified soon after, and the correct figure was incorporated into the system, which is what reflects in the communication to the Media and the stock exchanges on May 3, 2018.","28-Jun-2018 20:10:00","2018-06-28 20:10:00","-","-","https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/corporate/StxClarification28062018_28062018201020_067.zip"
