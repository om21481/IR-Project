Vitax is one of the loading players in the Polish speciality tea segment. Their range of fruit, herbal and green teas complements the Tetley portfolio of black and Earl Grey teas. The acquisition springboards Tetley to the number two position in the Polish tea market with a 10.5% value share* and a turnover of $36 million, Premium Foods currently distribute the Tetley brand in Poland alongside Vitax and Flosana. This distribution arrangement will continue. In a statement, Garry Nield, Managing Director of Europe and Emerging Markets for the Tetley Group, commented ""Tetley already has a strong business in Poland built on black and Earl Grey teas. There is significant potential to grow the fruit and herbal market in Poland and it makes sense for us to acquire an established and successful range of fruit and herbal products, rather than start afresh with a new Tetley range. This transaction will allow Tetley to offer the Polish tea drinker a wider choice of great tasting teas whilst continuing our strong distribution arrangements to deliver outstanding customer service"".","26-Apr-2007 10:48:00","2007-04-26 10:48:00","-","-","-"
