If the approval is not received post timely application, then the Lessee can continue to operate the mine under deemed renewal. In respect of six Bauxite Mines at Jharkhand, the company had applied Second Renewal of Mining Lease as per stipulated time, and these mines were operating under the provision of deemed renewal. Bauxite from the said mines was supplied at Muri and Renukoot Alumina Refinery. After the Supreme Court Judgement in the matter Goa Foundation, the Government of India, vide its Gazette Notification amended the provisions of the Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules , 2014, whereby all companies operating under the first renewal were required to obtain the mining lease within two years from the date of notifications. In view of the said amendment in the MCR, deemed provisions for the second and subsequent renewal is henceforth not available. The State of Jharkhand therefore in compliance with the said amendment issued the notices to the Company on 9th September, 2014 in respect of the aforesaid mines to stop the operation till the Second renewal is formally granted by the State of Jharkhand. Accordingly, operations at the said mines were stopped. Since the Company had already applied for the Second renewal as per stipulated time and formal second renewals was not received, company has already submitted its further request to the State of Jharkhand on 08.09.2014 to expedite the second renewal under the provisions of Section 8 (3) of the MMDR Act. The Government of India had advised the State Government for considering expeditious renewal in terms of Section 8 (3) of MMDR Act. The Company expects that these renewals will be granted within a period of six months, and therefore above event will not have any adverse material impact in near future on the operation and performance of the Company, as the Company has sufficient inventory and other operating mines in the area which also supply bauxite to its Alumina Refineries at Muri and Renukoot.

"HINDALCO","Hindalco Industries Limited","Miscellaneous","Hindalco Industries Ltd. has informed the Exchange that the recent rains and floods have inundated several parts of Gujarat and have cut-off road traffic resulting in serious dislocations in the movement of essential inputs and personnel staying away from the site. This has, like in many other installations in these areas, disrupted the normal operations of the Company's copper smelter at Dahej (Gujarat) and has necessitated a scale down in plant operations. This is likely to affect production for a short period, but its overall impact on the company is not likely to be significant.","06-Jul-2005 00:00:00","2005-07-06 00:00:00","-","-","-"
