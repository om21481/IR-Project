The Company has clarified that ""The Company had over the last two years reduced its exposure in the construction equipment business given the difficult state of infrastructure sector in India. The Company systematically reduced its exposure from a peak of over Rs. 1,000 crore of receivables under financing down to Rs. 448 crore as of 31 March 2014. The decision to reduce exposure in this business has been communicated in the annual reports of the Company for FY13 and FY14. Given the continued poor performance and no visibility of improvement in this sector in the near term, the Company has decided to exit this business. The decision to exit this business has no material impact on the operations of the Company since this business contributes to less than 2% of its total receivables under finance"".","21-Jul-2014 19:20:00","2014-07-21 19:20:00","-","-","-"

This resulted in manipulation of a few customer EMI payments and consequent mis-reporting of delinquencies. The early detection and quick investigation carried by the company has resulted in the incidence having no material financial loss. The RBI NPA provisioning standards require NBFCs to provision at 180 DPD. Based on RBI norms, there is a Rs. 15 Lacs provision to be made on account of this event; however, the gross and net NPA remains unchanged. Since, the company maintains a more stringent provisioning policy over RBI norms, an additional provision of up to Rs. 5 Crores may be required in the current quarter.
