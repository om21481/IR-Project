2.The Company's Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34,

generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations.

3.We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to
whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to
inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus
provide less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do
not express an audit opinion.
4.Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards (' Ind AS')
specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules
issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed
the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including the
manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3.We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard
requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the
Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an
audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD 1/44/2019 dated 
March 29, 2019 issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of 
the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
4.The Statement includes the results of the entities as mentioned in Annexure 1.
5.Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based
on the consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 6 below, nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in
accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian
Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing
Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material
misstatement.

6.The accompanying Statement includes the unaudited interim financial results and other financial

The independent auditor's reports on interim financial results of these entities have been furnished
to us by the Management and our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts 
and disclosures in respect of these subsidiaries is based solely on the report of such auditors and 
procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 3 above. 
Our conclusion on the Statement in respect of matters stated in para 6 above is not modified with
respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors.
