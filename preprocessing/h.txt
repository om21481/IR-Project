Such endeavours create enduring value for our stakeholders and the nation. \nToday, the world is traversing through unprecedented \nchallenges emerging from a ‘polycrisis’ encompassing climate change, widening inequality, geo-political issues and reglobalisation. A new global economic order is being shaped with these crises spurring new strategies, innovations and business models. Addressing these challenges and opportunities, ITC has crafted a comprehensiveITC Next vision to build a future-tech, innovative, climate positive, sustainable and inclusive enterprise, powered by agility, competitiveness, resilience and consumer centricity. New avenues for growth have been identiﬁed, whilst fortifying existing businesses and putting in place higher order structural competitiveness to create new vitality for the enterprise. These strategic interventions will make a growing contribution to the nation in its journey to the Amrit Kaal.\nAs a core element of ITC Next, ITC has been \nexploring opportunities to craft disruptive business models anchored at the intersection of the two mega trends of Digital and Sustainability, while leveraging the Company’s institutional strengths. This has enabled ITC to unleash new vectors of growth with interventions like ITCMAARS – a ‘phygital’ farmer empowerment ecosystem, Food Tech Services and Sustainable Packaging. In addition, new drivers of growth are also being pursued through value accretive acquisitions and exports.\nITC’s diversiﬁed portfolio of future-ready businesses, \nspanning FMCG, Paperboards & Packaging, Agri Business, Hotels and Information Technology, enables it to contribute meaningfully to all 3 sectors of the Indian economy. To infuse new energy into the growth drivers of the future, signiﬁcant investments are being made across building assets, accelerating digital transformation, powering R&D infrastructure and in raising the bar in sustainability to build an enterprise of tomorrow.REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023\nITC: Transforming Agriculture\nAgriculture is a critical pillar of the Indian economy, \nengaging with more than half of the nation’s workforce. The sector also plays a vital role in providing food, fuel, ﬁbre, fodder and nutrition security. However, farming remains extremely vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change. Endeavours to usher in a new dimension of agricultural development must focus on enhancing the competitiveness of the sector by improving productivity, enabling value addition, effectively linking farmers to markets and promoting regenerative agriculture. \nITC is a leading Agri Business player in India, \nsupporting 20 value chain clusters. The Company has been sourcing over 4.5 million tonnes of agri commodities from 22 states and is today the largest procurer of wheat in the private sector. ITC’s Agri Business is also one of India\'s largest exporters of agri commodities and provides competitive advantage to ITC’s FMCG Businesses through distinctive sourcing capabilities. ITC’s world-class FMCG brands also anchor demand-driven agri value chains. \nITC has a century-old legacy of farmer \nempowerment. Building on the ITC e-Choupal programme that has empowered 4 million farmers in the last two decades, ITC is now ushering in NextGen Agriculture with a three-pronged approach. First, ITC aims to bring the power of digital to the agri sector through its‘phygital’ platform, ITCMAARS (Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services), a programme that delivers hyperlocal and personalised solutions by synergistically integrating NextGen agri-technologies to empower farmers. Second, ITC is rapidly scaling up its value-added agri portfolio straddling multiple value chains comprising Spices, Coffee, Frozen Marine Products and \nProcessed Fruits amongst others. Third, to address the challenges of climate change, ITC has introduced a range of sustainable agricultural practices under its climate-smart agriculture (CSA) programme.\nIn line with India’s focus on promoting millets as the \ngrain of the future, ITC has launched a dedicated initiative titled ‘ITC Mission Millets’ leveraging its enterprise strengths in agriculture, food and hospitality. This initiative is focused on developing a‘good for you’ range of products, implementation of sustainable farming systems and enhancing consumer awareness.\nITC - Making in India \nRecognising that it is important to create national \nassets and in alignment with the Government’s vision to ‘Make in India’, ITC has invested signiﬁcantly in building world-class manufacturing, intellectual and hospitality assets for India. ITC’s contribution includes creating world-class Indian brands that bring about superior value-capture in the economy, setting up of a network of state-of-the-art Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing facilities across the country to support indigenous value chains, developing a globally benchmarked Life Sciences & Technology Centre for cutting edge R&D and innovation that contributes to building intellectual capital for the nation. ITC has also built iconic hotel assets that not only enrich the nation’s tourism landscape but are also a trailblazer in green hoteliering through their ethos of ‘Responsible Luxury’. Such assets create enduring value forITC and the nation.REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023\nITC – Reimagining Sustainability \nClimate change has emerged as an existential threat \nthat requires building of resilience through innovative solutions for both mitigation and adaptation. It is heartening that India is leading the world in climate action with the nation ranking ﬁrst overall among all G20 members in the Climate Performance Index. India’s updated NDCs, its global collaboration “One Sun, One World, One Grid” to promote solar energy, the National Hydrogen Mission demonstrate India’s leadership in the area.   \nFor decades, ITC has been acclaimed as a global \nexemplar in sustainability. Aligning with the nation’s climate action plan, ITC has now crafted a comprehensive strategy to pursue a low carbon growth path through extensive decarbonisation programmes across its operations and value chains, while also implementing largescale adaptation initiatives encompassing water stewardship, biodiversity, CSA, among others. Recognising the social challenges of inequity and livelihood \ngeneration, ITC has adopted a 2-horizon approach to support livelihoods and contribute to inclusive growth, especially in rural areas. The ﬁrst horizon aims at securing and strengthening the dominant sources of livelihood through extensive programmes for farmer empowerment, while the second focuses on building capabilities for the future in areas such as primary education, vocational training, women empowerment, healthcare and so on.\nReimagining sustainability to address the challenges \nof climate crisis and livelihood creation, ITC has now embarked on an even more ambitious Sustainability 2.0 journey to raise the bar to create a secure and better tomorrow.\nThe following pages provide a glimpse into ITC’s \nmulti-dimensional growth drivers that are propelling the Company to a new horizon of competitive and sustainable progress, while contributing to India’s journey to Amrit Kaal.*for the year ended 31st March, 2023200+\nManufacturing\nUnitsGross Revenue`69,481 cr\n25+\nWorld-class\nMother Brands12\nFuture-ready Businesses across Agriculture,Manufacturing and Services\n4.5 mn \ntonnes of Agri Commodities ThroughputREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023\nITC’s Triple Bottomline Contribution\nEconomic\nEBITDA`23,944 cr\nAmong Top 3 \nCorporates in the Private Sector in Terms of\nContribution to Exchequer over the Years75%\nof Value-added Accrues to the ExchequerNearly \nTotal Dividend\n`19,255 crNet Cash from Operating Activities\n`17,912 crITC Life Sciences\nand Technology Centre -\nRanked Top \nInnovator in India*Social\nEnvironmental60 Lakh\nSustainable \nLivelihoods Supportede-Choupal:\n40 Lakh\nFarmers EmpoweredOver 50 Lakh Women\nBeneﬁtted through Multi-dimensional \nProgrammes\nLivestock Development:\nOver 21.3 Lakh\nMilch Animals CoveredSkilling and Vocational Training:\nOver 1.2 Lakh\nYouth EnrolledPrimary Education:\nOver 11.2 Lakh\nChildren Beneﬁtted\nWatershed Development:\nOver 14.7 Lakh\nAcres Covered Afforestation: \nOver 10.4 Lakh\nAcres Greened Biodiversity Conservation:\nOver 2.9 Lakh\nAcres Covered \nWell-being Out of Waste Covers:\nOver 2.2 Crore\nCitizens\n40\nPlatinum-Rated\nGreen BuildingsAround 43%\nof ITC\'s Energy is from \nRenewable SourcesClimate Smart Agriculture:\nAcres Covered in 17 states 23.4 Lakh ITC is\nPlastic Neutral\nCollecting and Sustainably \nManaging 60,000 MT of WasteREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023\nITC’s Triple Bottomline Contribution\nITC Malur is the\nFirst Foods \nFactory in Asia,\nwhile ITC Kovai is the\nFirst Paper Mill  \nglobally to receive AWS \nPlatinum certiﬁcation *amongst Indian Pharma & Health Care Pvt.

Its governance framework enjoins the highest standards of ethical and responsible conduct of business to create value for all stakeholders. \nTHE COMPANY’S GOVERNANCE \nPHILOSOPHY \nITC defines Corporate Governance as a systemic \nprocess by which companies are directed and controlled to enhance their wealth-generating capacity. Since large corporations employ a vast quantum of societal resources, ITC believes that the governance process should ensure that these resources are utilised in a manner that meets stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations. This belief is reflected in the Company’s deep commitment to contribute to the “triple bottom line”, namely conservation and development of the nation’s economic, social and environmental capital.ITC’s Corporate Governance structure, systems and \nprocesses are based on two core principles:\n(i)\n  Manageme\nnt must have the executive freedom \nto drive the enterprise forward without undue \nrestraints, and\n(ii)\n  This freedom of management should be\n \nexercised within a framework of effective accountability.\nITC believes that any meaningful policy on Corporate Governance must empower the executive management of the Company. At the  \nsame time, Governance should create a mechanism of checks and balances to ensure that the decision-making powers vested in the executive management are used with care and responsibility to meet stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations. \nFrom this definition and core principles of Corporate \nGovernance emerge the cornerstones of ITC’s governance philosophy, namely trusteeship, transparency, ethical corporate citizenship, empowerment & accountability and control.  ITC believes that the practice of each of these creates the right corporate culture that fulfils the true purpose of Corporate Governance.\n12 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedReport on Corporate Governance\nTHE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\nThe practice of Corporate Governance in ITC takes \nplace at three interlinked levels:\nStrategic supervision by the Board of Directors\nStrategic management by the Corporate Management \nCommittee\nExecutive  \nmanagementby the Divisional Chief Executive \nassisted by the Divisional Management Committee\nThe three-tier governance structure ensures that:\n(a)  Strategic supervision (on behalf of the Shareholders),  \nbeing free from involvement in the task of strategic \nmanagement of the Company, can be conducted by the Board with objectivity, thereby sharpening accountability of management;(b)\n  \nStrategic management of the Company, \nuncluttered by the day-to-day tasks of executive \nmanagement, remains focused and energised; and\n(c)\n  Executive management of\n the divisional business \nfree from collective strategic responsibilities for ITC as a whole, remains focused on enhancing the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the business to achieve best-in-class performance. \nThe core roles of the key entities flow from this structure. These roles, in turn, determine the core responsibilities of each entity. In order to discharge such responsibilities, each entity is empowered \nformally with requisite powers. Trusteeship recognises that large corporations, which represent a coalition of interests, namely \nthose of the shareholders, other providers of capital, business associates and employees, have both an economic and a social purpose, thereby casting the responsibility on the  \nBoard of Directors to protect and enhance shareholder value, as well as fulfil obligations to other stakeholders. Inherent in the concept of trusteeship is the responsibility to ensure equity, namely, that the rights of all shareholders, large or small, are protected. Trusteeship\nTransparencyTransparency  means explaining the Company’s policies and actions to those to whom it has \nresponsibilities. Externally, this means maximum appropriate disclosures without jeopardising the Company’s strategic interests and internally, this means openness in the Company’s relationship with its employees and in the conduct of its business. ITC believes transparency enhances accountability.\nEthical Corporate Citizenship means setting exemplary standards of ethical behaviour, both internally within the organisation, as well as in external relationships. ITC believes that unethical behaviour corrupts organisational culture and undermines stakeholder value. Governance processes in ITC continuously reinforce and help realise the Company’s belief in ethical corporate citizenship.Ethical \nCorporate Citizenship\nControl ensures that freedom of management is exercised within a framework of checks and \nbalances and is designed to prevent misuse of power, facilitate timely management of change and ensure effective management of risks. ITC believes that control is a necessary concomitant of its second core principle of governance that freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of appropriate checks and balances. \nControl\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 13 ITC LimitedEmpowerment is a process of unleashing creativity and innovation throughout the organisation by truly vesting decision-making powers at the most appropriate levels and as close to the scene of action as feasible, thereby helping actualise the potential of its employees. Empowerment is an essential concomitant of ITC’s first core principle of governance that management must have the freedom to drive the enterprise forward. ITC believes that empowerment combined with accountability provides an impetus to performance and improves effectiveness, thereby \nenhancing shareholder value. Empowerment  \n& \nAccountabilityThe structure, processes and practices of governance \nare designed to support effective management of multiple businesses while retaining focus on each  one of them. \nThe Governance Document that sets out the  \nstructure, policies and practices of governance is available on the Company’s corporate website at  https://www.itcportal.com/governance-document .\nROLES OF VARIOUS ENTITIES\nBoard of Directors (‘Board’): The primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship to protect and enhance shareholder value through strategic supervision of  ITC and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

However, geopolitical tensions, continued supply chain dislocations and climate crisis resulted in unprecedented inflation and volatility in global commodity and energy prices. Central banks across the world responded swiftly with sharp increase in interest rates within a relatively short time frame.  As per IMF estimates, global GDP growth slowed to 3.4% during 2022, well below projections made  \nat the beginning of the year. Growth in Advanced  \nEconomies decelerated sharply to 2.7% in 2022  (Vs. 5.4% in 2021) while Emerging Markets &  Developing Economies grew at a relatively slower pace of 4.0% (Vs. 6.9% in 2021), mainly impacted by lower growth in China.\nGoing forward, the global macroeconomic \nenvironment continues to be confronted with myriad challenges; these include the continuing impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, global inflation remaining sticky and at elevated levels, recessionary pressures in most Advanced Economies, spectre of stress in\n \nthe financial sector and the cost-of-living crisis in \nseveral economies, especially in the near term. As\n \nper \nIMF estimates, aggregate global economic growth is expected to further decelerate to 2.8% in 2023. Advanced Economies are projected to grow at 1.3% with major economies such as the United States  and Euro Area set to grow at a slower pace than 2022. Emerging Markets and Developing Economies are estimated to grow by 3.9% in 2023 as against 4.0% in 2022. As priority of policy makers currently centre largely around inflation control, the monetary policies of central banks would remain a key monitorable in the near term.\nThe Indian economy remained a bright spot in  \nFY 2022-23 amidst the global slowdown. Real  \nGDP growth for the year is estimated at 7.0%  \n(first half: 9.6%; second half: 4.8%) with Nominal GDP growth at 15.9% (first half: 22.3%; second half: 10.5%), reflecting the inflationary pressures in the economy. While Agriculture grew by 3.3% in real terms, Services and Industry sectors grew by 9.4% and 3.6% respectively, on a soft base. With steep inflation eating into household budgets, consumption demand remained subdued in rural markets and for discretionary categories in urban markets. \nIn spite of severe global headwinds, India remained \none of the fastest growing major economies enabled by purposeful interventions by policy makers. The Government of India has continued its thrust on structural reforms to raise India’s potential growth. During the year, concerted efforts continued to be made towards shaping India as a global manufacturing hub through policy initiatives such  \nas Production Linked Incentive (PLI), Make in India,  \nPM Gati Shakti, National Monetisation Pipelin e Management Discussion and Analysis  \nFor the Financial Year Ended 31st March, 2023&\nThe Indian economy remained a bright spot in FY 2022-23 amidst the  \nglobal slowdown. The Government of India has continued its thrust  \non structural reforms to raise India’s potential growth. REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 39 ITC Limitedschemes and strengthening the  country’s digital public \ninfrastructure as well as the healthcare infrastructure. \nFurther, astute management of macros including fiscal and monetary policies also aided in mitigating the volatility in the operating environment.\nWhile the pace of growth of the Indian economy is \nprojected to decelerate in FY 2023-24 against the backdrop of global macro headwinds as aforestated, India would continue to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. Even as inflation is projected to soften on an overall basis, prices of certain  \nindustry-specific commodities are expected to remain elevated with continued geopolitical issues and supply  chain disruptions. The year is also expected to witness ‘El\n \nNino’ weather phenomenon after three consecutive \n‘La Nina’ years; the impact of this on monsoon, along with related events like heatwaves, spatial and temporal rainfall distribution etc. will remain a key monitorable for agri output, inflation and consumer demand in 2023. A good Rabi harvest, broad-based credit growth and Government’s thrust on capital spending to bolster investment activity supported by buoyant tax collections, augur well for the economy going forward. Healthier Bank and Corporate Balance Sheets, improving capacity utilisation levels and structural reforms represent some of the key positive factors for revival in private capex. \nIndia is widely acknowledged as one of the most \ndynamic major economies in the world with immense headroom for growth over the medium and long term. A favourable demographic profile, increasing affluence, rapid urbanisation and accelerated digital adoption represent some of the key structural \ndrivers of growth of the Indian Economy. Policy  announcements in the Union Budget 2023 including \nfocus on expanding digital infrastructure, direct benefit transfer, etc. are expected to provide further impetus to enhance India’s competitiveness, enable greater empowerment and foster inclusive growth while maintaining the path to fiscal consolidation. Sharp step-up in capital expenditure outlay, focus on infrastructure and promotion of exports are expected to boost domestic manufacturing, spurring a virtuous consumption-investment-employment cycle.\nAs the Indian economy combats uncertainties in the \nexternal environment, policy interventions focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods and fostering inclusive growth augur well for the economy. Structural support would need to be provided to sectors with large economic multiplier impact; the development of robust domestic agri and wood-based value chains hold special importance in the Indian context given their enormous potential to contribute to national objectives. \nAgricultural sector plays a crucial role in the \neconomy with about half of the Indian workforce engaged in the sector. As reported in earlier years, enhancing agricultural productivity and value addition to international standards, while simultaneously improving market linkages, remain critical to enhance the competitiveness of the agricultural sector and drive significant increase in farmers’ income. India is the leading producer worldwide of several commodities, including pulses, spices, fruits such as bananas, etc. While India’s agri exports have grown sharply over the last few years to reach appx.  US$ 53 billion in FY 2022-23, its share of global  \nagri-trade remains low at only about 3% . \nReport of the Board of Directors\nAgricultural sector plays a crucial role in the economy.

According to an article in the Harvard Business Review, global food demand is expected to increase by up to 98% by 2050.  \nAn exponential increase in production and productivity will be required to meet the growing needs of an increasing population at a time when natural resources are fast depleting and the impact of climate change is becoming more severe. Evolving consumer preferences will also require nutritious food that is sustainably sourced. These developments accentuate the need to enhance the competitiveness of  agri-value chains in order to cater to the dynamic market requirements of the future. India with its tremendous strengths in agriculture has a unique opportunity to play a leading role in this global transition and in forging an eco-system of sustainable, regenerative and climate smart agriculture.\nAgainst this background, the Government’s initiative \nto promote Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) as the core catalyst of agricultural transformation can indeed leverage economies of scale, enable sustainable agriculture, support market-led production and create larger market access. FPOs provide the power of the collective to small and marginal farmers. FPOs have a tremendous potential to serve as major enablers in augmenting farm livelihoods, by facilitating a crucial link between markets and individual farmers.\nIn this context, your Company has adopted targeted \ncollaborative models to multiply the scale and impact of its agri and rural interventions. This collaborative approach, as opposed to a traditional transactional approach, can contribute meaningfully toward s building next generation agriculture that is climate \nresilient and capable of supporting gainful livelihoods. Digitalisation of agriculture also offers the potential to increase productivity and foster structural changes across the value chain thereby enabling efficient use of resources. In line with its commitment to harness the power of cutting-edge digital technologies and unlock the potential of India’s farmers, your Company had launched ITCMAARS (Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services). This ‘phygital’  \necosystem will empower the farming community and FPOs by delivering hyperlocal and personalised solutions by synergistically integrating NextGen  \nagri-technologies. Further details on this transformative  \ninitiative are provided in the Agri Business section  of this report.\nThe Government of India has inspired the United \nNations to declare 2023 as the ‘International Year of Millets’. This has indeed drawn global attention to this ‘super-grain’ that has the potential to redefine agriculture with its unique value proposition. Millets are climate resilient crops using substantially lesser water than other staples and grow in half the time as other crops, offering a comprehensive solution for sustained food security.\nYour Company has spearheaded ‘ITC Mission Millets’, leveraging its enterprise strengths in agriculture, food and hospitality to implement multi-dimensional interventions in this area. The holistic programme follows a strategic 3-fold approach – 1) developing a ‘good-for-you’ product portfolio, 2) implementing sustainable farming systems, and 3) enhancing consumer awareness through an Educate, Empower and Encourage approach.

To cater to  \nthe diverse needs of consumers, your Company has \nlaunched products across traditional and modern\n \nformats viz. ‘Gluten Free Flour’, ‘Multi-Millet Mix’ and  \n‘Ragi Flour’, Vermicelli and Biscuits under the ‘Aashirvaad’ and ‘Sunfeast’ brands. Your Company\n  \nhas also designed products that suit every meal occasion like millet idlis for breakfast, biscuits & cookies\n \nfor snacking and noodles & pasta for other meals.  \nThe thrust on millets is further exemplified by the Hotels Business creating easy-to-try recipes with millets to help\n \nencourage individuals experiment with the taste and texture of millets. \nIn line with your Company’s commitment to empower farmers, your Company has developed a millets agri-value chain with special thrust on enhancing value-addition and market linkages. Your Company is also promoting FPOs in millet farming anchored by ITCMAARS. The Agri Business Division has implemented two Public-Private Partnerships projects in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, in partnership with Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad. Your Company remains committed to supporting the Government’s efforts to promote millets given their immense benefits in terms of nutritional properties and attributes as a planet friendly and climate resilient crop. \nIt is pertinent to note that a substantial quantum of \nfood is wasted along the chain in India, depending on the inherent perishability of the crop and the season. Higher levels of food processing in the economy can create a much larger pull for quality agri-commodities, thereby reducing farm wastages and raising farm incomes. This would require focused investments in developing product-specific climate-controlle d infrastructure as well as in branded products that  \nbenefit large agri-value chains. Corporate participation  \nis essential not only to invest in requisite infrastructure,  \nbut also to provide assured market linkages to \nfarmers. A big thrust on India’s Food Processing sector can play a pivotal role and have a multiplier effect which will lead to significant job creation, enhance rural incomes and help manage food inflation in a sustainable manner. In this context, the recently announced PLI Scheme for the Food Processing sector, with an estimated outlay of `\n \n10900 crores, is expected to play a critical role in \nboosting investments, agri exports, farmer incomes, employment generation and building Indian brands for the global market. Your Company has been included under the scheme for several of its Branded Packaged Foods Businesses and in the Agri Business, details of which are provided in the subsequent sections. \nSimilarly, the Agro-forestry sector, as a source of \nraw material for wood-based industry, is woefully constrained by policies that not only impede job creation in India but also promote avoidable imports. Recent policy interventions to enable greening of wastelands and providing financial assistance to members of marginalised communities taking up Agro-forestry is a commendable starting point to reverse this situation. Supportive policies in this area would go a long way in enhancing sustainable livelihoods, augmenting alternative sources of  energy (bio-fuel) and enabling import substitution for wood-based industries while simultaneously augmenting the Nation’s environmental capital. \nThe integrated nature of your Company’s \nbusiness models along with strategic investments \nto enhance efficiencies across its operating Report of the Board of Directors\nA big thrust on India’s Food Processing sector can play a pivotal role and have a  \nmultiplier effect.

During the year, over 10 lakh \nfarmers were trained on package of practices for principal crops of the region as well as on livestock management, taking the cumulative number of farmer interactions to over 44 lakh. Estimates indicate yield improvement of up to 30% for cotton, maize, paddy and soyabean in locations covered by the programm e; similarly, cost of cultivation is estimated to have \nreduced by nearly 15%, resulting in expansion of farmer incomes by\n \nup\n \nto 60%. \nYour Company has also partnered with the State Government of Andhra Pradesh towards improving  \nthe quality of chilli produced in the country to meet global standards. A Public Private Partnership programme\n \n- ‘Integrated Agri-Extension Platform for \nChilli Farm Value Chain Development’ - has been conceptualised under which 40,000 farmers covering about 1,00,000 acres are expected to be benefited by 2025. In\n \nFY\n \n2022-23, the programme covered \nover 17,500 farmers and over 72,600 acres across 135\n \nvillages.

More importantly, the smuggled cigarettes are, on an average, 50 percent cheaper in the Indian Market, compared to the price of any similar cigarette brand. From a public health perspective, the smuggling of cigarettes also poses a very serious challenge since a part of the smuggled cigarettes are counterfeits and the quality of tobacco and other ingredients used in  \nthe said cigarettes, is inferior.”\nTobacco control measures in India have ranked \namongst the most stringent in the world from the time of enactment of the Cigarettes (Regulation of Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 1975, to the present. India is also one of the few countries where tobacco products are regulated across the value chain\n \n– from their manufacture to sale to consumers. \nThe Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Product s (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade \nand Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA) requires cigarette packages to display the statutorily mandated pictorial and textual warnings covering 85% of the surface area of the packet - one of the largest in the world. \nIt may be observed that smuggled international brands of cigarettes do not bear any of the pictorial or textual warnings mandated by Indian laws or, bear much smaller pictorial/textual warnings as per the tobacco laws of the countries from where these cigarettes originate. As reported in prior years, findings from research conducted by IMRB International, an independent market research organisation, show that the lack of pictorial warnings on packets of smuggled international brands of cigarettes or their diminutive size creates a perception in the consumers’ mind that these illicit cigarettes are ‘safer’ than domestic duty-paid  cigarettes that carry the 85% pictorial warnings. The combination of low prices to consumers due to tax evasion and the misleading perception created by the absence of statutory pictorial warnings provides significant buoyancy to illicit cigarette volumes.\nIndia is among the top three tobacco growing countries in the world. Tobacco plays a significant role in the Indian economy on account of its considerable contribution to the agricultural, industrial and export sectors\n2. The illicit cigarette trade also has \na deleterious impact on farmers and farm workers engaged in the tobacco value chain. In India, cigarettes are manufactured largely using Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco grown in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.

The illicit cigarette trade also has a  \ndeleterious impact on farmers and farm workers engaged  \nin the tobacco value chain.tobaccos, in  addition to revenue losses, the growth \nof illicit cigarette trade has also resulted in a sharp\n \ndrop in demand for Indian FCV tobaccos in the \ndomestic\n \nmarket. \nIt is pertinent to note that several other major tobacco producing countries, including the USA, have established regulatory frameworks taking into consideration the economic interests of their tobacco farmers. The punitive and discriminatory taxation & regulatory regime on cigarettes in India continues to adversely affect the livelihood of Indian tobacco farmers with corresponding gains to those countries that have opted for moderate and equitable tobacco regulations. These developments, coupled with lower availability of Indian crop, lower export incentives in India and relative weakness of currencies in certain competing geographies have had a debilitating impact on 46 million livelihoods comprising tobacco farmers, farm workers, etc. who are dependent on the tobacco value chain. It is estimated that since 2014, Indian tobacco farmers have suffered a cumulative drop in earnings of over ` 7500 crores. \nAs reported in earlier years, your Company and several other stakeholders had challenged the validity of the pictorial and textual warning covering 85% of the surface area of the packet prescribed under COTPA. The Honourable Karnataka High Court, by its judgement in December, 2017, held the 85% pictorial warnings to be factually incorrect and unconstitutional. Upon Special Leave Petitions filed by the Government and others, the Honourable Supreme Court has stayed the judgment of the High Court. The cases are pending before the Honourable Supreme Court. \nThe extremely stringent regulations along with the \ndiscriminatory and steep taxation on cigarettes have had numerous negative, albeit unintended \nrepercussions. These include:\n–\n rapid growth\n in illicit cigarette volumes, which \nresulted in sub-optimisation of the revenue \npotential of the tobacco sector and significant loss to the Exchequer. It is estimated that on account of illicit cigarettes alone, revenue loss to the Government is appx. ` 15500 crores per annum.\n–\n widespread\n availability of illicit cigarettes and  \nother tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene to consumers at extremely affordable prices. As a result, despite accounting for less than  1/10th of the tobacco consumed in the country, duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than 4/5th of the revenue generated from the tobacco sector.\n–\n a large component of tobacco consumption in the country, aggregating around 68%, remaining outside the tax net. \n–\n persistent negative impact o\nn the livelihood of \ntobacco farmers and others dependent on tobacco. Studies by the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) indicate that on account of agro-climatic conditions, there is no equally remunerative alternate crop that can be grown in the FCV tobacco growing regions of the country.\nYour Company continues to engage with policy makers for a framework of pragmatic, equitable, non-discriminatory, evidence-based regulations and taxation policies that balance the economic imperatives of the country and tobacco control objectives, cognising for the unique tobacco consumption pattern in India.

Sequential moderation was witnessed during the second half of the year, primarily due to inventory pipeline adjustments by export customers and relatively lower offtake by domestic customers towards the end of the year. Cost of key inputs remained elevated with global pulp prices witnessing unprecedented highs during the first half of the year on account of global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, adverse weather events, higher power and chemical costs. However, pulp prices moderated in the second half of the year due to subdued Chinese demand, recessionary conditions in Europe and progressive normalisation in supply chain operations. Chemical prices, which were also at record highs, moderated towards the end of the financial year, while remaining elevated over pre-pandemic levels. Coal supplies were adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions and prioritisation of domestic supplies to thermal power plants. The Indian Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar during the year which further impacted cost of imports. \nAmidst heightened inflationary pressures, the \nBusiness delivered robust performance during the year leveraging its integrated business model and strong end-user engagements.

However, surging inflation on account of high fuel and other commodity prices spurred by geopolitical developments and external sector imbalances emerged as major challenges for the economy. Nepal Rastra Bank along with the Government of Nepal responded to these challenges through multiple policy actions such as increase in interest rates and imposition of restrictions on import of certain luxury goods from April to December 2022. These policy measures along with robust inward remittances helped stabilise the country’s current account and balance of payments.

Measures towards encouraging Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the country, incentivising domestic manufacturing to substitute imports, promoting the hospitality sector which has significant potential to generate foreign exchange earnings and employment, on-ground implementation of reforms and promulgation of industry-friendly policies continue to remain the key imperatives for sustained economic growth. \nThe legal cigarette industry is a major contributor to \nthe manufacturing sector of the country.

The ITC Code of Conduct commits management to financial and accounting policies, systems and processes. The Corporate Governance Policy and the ITC Code of Conduct stand widely communicated across the enterprise at all times and together with the Strategy of Organisation, Planning & Review Processes and the Risk Management Framework provide the foundation for Internal Financial Controls with reference to your Company’s Financial Statements.\nSuch Financial Statements are prepared on the \nbasis of the Significant Accounting Policies that are carefully selected by management and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board. These Policies are supported by the Corporate Accounting and Systems Policies that apply to the entity as a whole to implement the tenets of Corporate Governance and Significant Accounting Policies uniformly across your Company.

These, in turn, are supported by a set of Divisional policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that have been established for individual Businesses.\nYour Company uses Enterprise Resource Planning \n(ERP) systems as a business enabler and also to maintain its books of accounts. The SOPs, in tandem with transactional controls built into the ERP systems, ensure appropriate segregation of duties, tiered approval mechanisms and maintenance of supporting records.

Based on the results of such assessment carried out by management, no reportable material weakness or significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal financial controls was observed.

The management of risk is embedded in the corporate strategies of developing a portfolio of world-class businesses that best match organisational capability with opportunities in domestic and international markets, developing capabilities and competencies for the future in order to enhance competitiveness and win in the markets of tomorrow. Accordingly, management of risk has always been an integral part of your Company’s ‘Strategy of Organisation’ and straddles its planning, execution and reporting processes & systems. Backed by strong internal control systems, the current Risk Management Framework consists of the following key\n \nelements: \n– The Corpor\nate Governance Policy, approved \nby the Board, clearly lays down the roles and responsibilities of the various entities in relation to risk management covering a range of responsibilities, from the strategic to the operational. These role definitions, inter ali a,  Report of the Board of Directors\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 91 ITC Limitedprovide the foundation for appropriate risk \nmanagement procedures, their effective implementation across your Company and independent monitoring and reporting by  \nInternal Audit. \n–\n The Risk Management Com\nmittee, constituted by \nthe Board, monitors and reviews the strategic risk management plans of your Company as a whole and provides necessary directions on the same. \n–\n The Corpor\nate Risk Management Cell, through \nfocused interactions with Businesses, facilitates the identification and prioritisation of strategic and operational risks, development of appropriate mitigation strategies and conducts periodic reviews of the progress on the management of identified\n \nrisks.\n– A combination of centrally issued policies and Divisionally-evolved procedures brings robustness to the process of ensuring that business risks are effectively addressed.\n–\n Appropriate\n structures are in place to proactively \nmonitor and manage the inherent risks in businesses with unique/relatively high risk profiles. \n–\n Foreign cur\nrency exposures continue to be \nmanaged within the framework of the Forex Manual. \n–\n A strong and independent I\nnternal Audit function at \nthe Corporate level carries out risk focused audits across all Businesses, enabling identification of areas where risk management processes may need to be strengthened.

Businesses are required to confirm periodically that all relevant risks have been identified, assessed, evaluated and that appropriate mitigation systems have been implemented. \nYour Company endeavours to continuously sharpen its Risk Management systems and processes in line with a rapidly changing business environment. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that some of the key Businesses of your Company have adopted the ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard and accordingly, the Risk Management systems and processes prevalent in these Businesses have been independently assessed to be compliant with the said global Standard on Risk Management.

This is being addressed in a comprehensive manner by optimising packaging design, introducing recycled content in packaging, identifying alternative packaging material with lower environmental impact and supporting development of suitable end-of-life solutions for \npackaging waste. Your Company has successfully implemented multiple \nlarge-scale models of solid waste management  across the country. These models, based on principles of circular economy, are scalable,  \nreplicable and sustainable, and have enabled your Company to sustain its plastic neutral status since FY 2021-22. The approach is centred around treating waste as a resource and ensuring that minimal waste goes to landfill, which can be achieved only when waste is segregated at source. The initiatives focus on educating citizens on segregating waste at source  into dry & wet streams, ensuring that value is derived from these resources and, in the process, support sustainable livelihood for waste collectors. These models operate on a public-private partnership basis with active involvement of urban local bodies, civil society and the informal sector of waste collectors.\nYour Company has exceeded its commitment on \nplastic neutrality for the second consecutive year by collecting and sustainably managing more than 60,000 tonnes of plastic waste across 36 States/Union Territories, which is more than the plastic packaging utilised by your Company. \nYour Company’s waste recycling programme,  \n‘WOW – Well Being Out of Waste’, enables the creation of a clean & green environment and promotes sustainable livelihoods for waste collectors. During the year, the programme continued to be executed in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Chennai, Delhi, major towns of Telangana and several districts of Andhra Pradesh. The quantum of dry waste collected during the year was about 64,000 MT from over 1,270 wards. The programme has covered over  2.2 crore citizens in over 55 lakh households, 57 lakh school children and around 2,100 corporates since its inception. It has promoted sustainable livelihood for over 17,750 waste collectors by facilitating an effective collection system in collaboration with Municipal Corporations. The intervention has also created over 150 social entrepreneurs who are involved in maximising value capture from the collected dry waste.

In India, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised Repo rate by 250 bps which resulted in market interest rates moving higher across tenures. In addition, decline in the Banking system liquidity also contributed to increase in market interest rates, particularly in the short tenure segment. \nInvestment decisions relating to deployment of \nsurplus liquidity continued to be guided by the tenets of Safety, Liquidity and Return. Treasury operations focused on proactive rebalancing of port folio Report of the Board of Directors\n114 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limitedduration and mix in line with the evolving interest \nrate environment.

The weakness was largely attributable to strength of the US$ relative  \nto all major currencies during the year. Towards the end of the financial year inversion in US interest rate curve, decline in India’s trade deficit, relative strength of foreign exchange reserves and judicious interventions in the forex market by RBI provided support to the INR. \nTo effectively navigate the high volatility in currency \nmarkets, your Company adopted a proactive risk management strategy and actively managed foreign currency exposures through appropriate hedging strategies and market instruments to protect business\n \nmargins. \nDEPOSITS\nYour Company’s erstwhile Public Deposit Scheme \nclosed in the year 2000.

SINGHI\n Company SecretaryOn behalf of the Board\nKolkata, May 18, 2023152 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedNotes to the Financial Statements\n1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies\nStatement \tof\tCompliance\nThese financial statements have been prepared in\n \naccordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) \nnotified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the relevant presentation requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company adopted Ind AS from 1st April, 2016.\nBasis\n\t\nof\n\t\nPreparation\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with \nthe historical cost convention, except for certain items that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies.\nFair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset \nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and\n /\n or \ndisclosure purposes in these financial \nstatements is determined on such a basis, except for  \nshare-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 – Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 – Leases,  \nand measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable  \nvalue in Ind AS 2 – Inventories or value in use in  \nInd AS 36 – Impairment of Assets.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity \nwith Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nOperating\n\t\nCycle\nAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current \nor non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the \nCompanies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.\nProperty,\n\t\nPlant\n\t\nand\n\t\nEquipment\n\t\n–\n\t\nTangible\n\t\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost of \nacquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. For this purpose, cost includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of property, plant and equipment recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nCost is inclusive of inward freight, duties and taxes \nand incidental expenses related to acquisition.  \nIn respect of major projects involving construction, related  \npre-operational expenses form part of the value of assets capitalised. Expenses capitalised also include applicable borrowing costs for qualifying assets, if any. All upgradation\n /\n  \nenhancements are charged off as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits.\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised \nupon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset.  \nAny gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in Statement of  \nProfit and Loss.\nDepreciation of these assets commences when the assets \nare ready for their intended use which is generally on commissioning. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated in a manner that amortizes the cost (or other amount substituted for cost) of the assets after commissioning, less its residual value, over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 on a straight line basis. Land is not depreciated.\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment \nof the Company are  as follows: \nBuildings 30-60 Years\nLeasehold Improvements Shorter of lease period or estimated useful lives\nPlant and Equipment 3-25 Years\nFurniture and Fixtures 8-10 YearsVehicles 8-10 Years\nOffice Equipment 5 YearsREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 153 ITC Limited1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)\nAssets held under finance leases are depreciated over their \nexpected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.\nProperty, plant and equipment’s residual values and useful \nlives are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and changes, if any, are treated as changes in accounting estimate. \nIntangible\n\t\nAssets\nIntangible Assets that the Company controls and from \nwhich it expects future economic benefits are capitalised upon acquisition and measured initially: \na.\n \n for \nassets acquired in a business combination, at fair \nvalue on the date of acquisition. \nb. \n for \nseparately acquired assets, at cost comprising \nthe purchase price (including import duties and  \nnon-refundable taxes) and directly attributable costs to \nprepare the asset for its intended use.\nInternally generated assets for which the cost is clearly identifiable are capitalised at cost. Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised only after the technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use has been established. Thereafter, all directly attributable expenditure incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use are recognised as the cost of such assets. Internally generated brands, websites and customer lists are not recognised as intangible assets. \nThe carrying value of intangible assets includes deemed \ncost which represents the carrying value of intangible assets recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP.\nThe useful life of an intangible asset is considered finite \nwhere the rights to such assets are limited to a specified period of time by contract or law (e.g. patents, licences, trademarks, franchise and servicing rights) or the likelihood of technical, technological obsolescence (e.g. computer software, design, prototypes) or commercial obsolescence (e.g. lesser known brands are those to which adequate marketing support may not be provided). If, there are no such limitations, the useful life is taken to be indefinite. \nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over \ntheir estimated useful lives by the straight line method unless it is practical to reliably determine the pattern of benefits arising from the asset. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized.\nAll intangible assets are tested for impairment. Amortization \nexpenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Thus, after initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and\n  /  or impairment  \nlosses. \nThe useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to \ndetermine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. \nInvestment\n\t\nProperty\nProperties that are held for long-term rental yields and\n /\n or  \nf\nor capital appreciation are classified as investment \nproperties. Investment properties are stated at cost of \nacquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortise the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated. \nTransfers to, or from, investment properties are made at \nthe carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use.\nAn item of investment property is derecognised upon \ndisposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nIncome received from investment property is recognised \nin the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\nImpairment\n\t\nof\n\t\nAssets\nImpairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the \ncarrying amount of assets or cash generating units exceed their recoverable amount.\nRecoverable amount is higher of an asset’s net selling \nprice and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. \nImpairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed \nwhen there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised no longer exist or have decreased. Such reversals are recognised as an increase in carrying amounts of assets to the extent that it does not exceed the Notes to the Financial Statements154 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limitedcarrying amounts that would have been determined (net of \namortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years.\nInventories\n\t\nI\nnventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable \nvalue. The cost is calculated on weighted average method. \nCost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to their present location and condition and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and sale.\nObsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are \nidentified from time to time and, where necessary, a provision is made for such inventories. \nForeign\n\t\nCurrency\n\t\nTransactions\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Company \nis Indian Rupee.\nTransactions in foreign currency are accounted for  \nat the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.  \nGains\n /\n l\nosses arising on settlement as also on translation \nof monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit \nand Loss.\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that, in \nsubstance, form part of the Company’s net investment  \nin a foreign operation (having a functional currency other than Indian Rupee) are accumulated in Foreign Currency Translation Reserve.\nDerivatives\n\t\nand\n\t\nHedge\n\t\nAccounting\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are \nsubsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains\n /\n losses \nare \nrecognised in Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the resulting gain\n /\n l\noss \nis recognised as per the hedge accounting principles  \nstated below.\nThe Company complies with the principles of hedge \naccounting where derivative contracts and\n /\n or\n  \nnon-derivative financial assets\n /\n liabilities \nthat are permitted \nunder applicable accounting standards are designated as hedging instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.(i)\n  Fair value he dges\n Changes \nin fair value of the designated portion of \nhedging instruments that qualify as fair value hedges \nare recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.  \nThe change in the fair value of the designated portion of hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.\n Hedge ac\ncounting is discontinued when the hedging \ninstrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. \n(ii)\n Cash flow he\ndges\n The \neffective portion of changes in the fair value of \nhedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedge Reserve’. The gains\n /\n losses \nrelating to the \nineffective portion are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n Amounts \npreviously recognised and accumulated in \nother comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of a non – financial asset, such gains\n /\n losses \nare transferred from equity (but not \nas reclassification adjustment) and included in the initial measurement cost of the non–financial asset. \n Hedge ac\ncounting is discontinued when the hedging \ninstrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gains\n /\n losses \nrecognised \nin other comprehensive income and accumulated in  \nequity at that time remain in equity and is reclassified when the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains\n /\n losses \naccumulated in equity  \nare recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nInvestment\n\tin\n\tSubsidiaries,\n\tAssociates\n\tand\n\tJoint\n\tVentures \t\nI\nnvestment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures \nare carried at cost less accumulated impairment, if any.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition of financial assets or financial liabilities. Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date when the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.\nFinancial\n\t\nAssets\nRecognition:  Financial assets include Investments, Trade \nReceivables, Advances, Security Deposits, Cash and Cash \nequivalents. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value or transaction price, as applicable, when the Company becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction price includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss. \nClassification: Management determines the classification \nof an asset at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on such classification.\nFinancial\n\t\nassets\n\t\nare\n\t\nclassified\n\t\nas\n\t\nthose\n\t\nmeasured\n\t\nat:\n\t\n(\na) amortised \ncost, where the financial assets are held \nsolely for collection of cash flows arising from payments \nof principal and\n /\n or interest. \n(\nb) f\nair value through other comprehensive income \n(FVTOCI), where the financial assets are held not only for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest but also from the sale of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. \n(c)\n fair \nvalue through profit or loss (FVTPL), where the \nassets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions based on the fair value of such assets. Such \nassets are subsequently measured at fair value, wi th unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the \nfair value being recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\nTrade Receivables, Advances, Security Deposits, Cash and Cash equivalents etc. are classified for measurement at amortised cost while investments may fall under any of the aforesaid classes. However, in respect of particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made to present subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.\nImpairment: The Company assesses at each reporting \ndate whether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) such as investments, trade receivables, advances and security deposits held at amortised cost and financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are tested for impairment based on evidence or information that is available without undue cost or effort. Expected credit losses are assessed and loss allowances recognised if the credit quality of the financial asset has deteriorated significantly since initial recognition. \nReclassification: When and only when the business \nmodel is changed, the Company shall reclassify all affected financial assets prospectively from the reclassification date as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss without restating the previously recognised gains, losses or interest and in terms of the reclassification principles laid down in the Ind AS relating to Financial Instruments. \nDerecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when \nthe right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Concomitantly, if the asset is one that is measured at:\n(a)\n amo\nrtised cost, the gain or loss is recognised in the \nStatement of Profit and Loss; \n(b) fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income, the \ncumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to \nreserves are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset represents an equity investment, in which case the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified within equity. \nIncome\n\tRecognition:  \nInterest income is recognised in the \nStatement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive dividend is \nestablished.   Notes to the Financial Statements\n1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)156 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedFinancial \tLiabilities\nBorrowings,\n trade payables and other financial liabilities \nare initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently \nmeasured at amortised cost. Any discount or premium on redemption\n /\n settlement is recognised in the Statement of\n \nProfit and Loss as finance cost over the life of the liability using the effective interest method and adjusted to the liability figure disclosed in the Balance Sheet. \nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is \nextinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or on expiry. \nOffsetting\n\t\nFinancial\n\t\nInstruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount \nis included in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nEquity\n\t\nInstruments\nEquity instruments are recognised at the value of the \nproceeds, net of direct costs of the capital issue.\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured at the transaction price that the \nCompany receives or expects to receive as consideration for goods supplied and services rendered, net of returns and estimates of variable consideration such as discounts to customers. Revenue from the sale of goods includes Excise Duties and National Calamity Contingent Duty which are payable on manufacture of goods but excludes taxes such as VAT and Goods and Services Tax which are payable in respect of sale of goods and services.\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised \nwhen the Company performs its obligations to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery and in case of services, in the period in which such services are rendered.\nGovernment\n\t\nGrant\nThe Company may receive government grants that require \ncompliance with certain conditions related to the Company’s operating activities or are provided to the Company by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria. \nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable \nassurance that the grant will be received upon the Company \ncomplying with the conditions attached to the grant. Accordingly, government grants:\n(a)\n relat\ned to or used for assets, are deducted from the \ncarrying amount of the asset.\n(b) related \nto incurring specific expenditures are taken to \nthe Statement of Profit and Loss on the same basis and \nin the same periods as the expenditures incurred. \n(c) by \nway of financial assistance on the basis of certain \nqualifying criteria are recognised as they become receivable.\nIn the unlikely event that a grant previously recognised is ultimately not received, it is treated as a change in estimate and the amount cumulatively recognised is expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \nDividend\n\t\nDistribution\nDividends paid (including income tax thereon) are \nrecognised in the period in which the interim dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, or in respect of the final dividend when approved by shareholders.\nEmployee\n\t\nBenefits\nThe Company makes contributions to both defined benefit \nand defined contribution schemes which are mainly administered through duly constituted and approved Trusts. \nProvident Fund contributions are in the nature of defined \ncontribution scheme. In respect of employees who are members of constituted and approved trusts, the Company recognises contribution payable to such trusts as an expense including any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investment and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India. In respect of other employees, provident funds are deposited with the Government and recognised as expense. \nThe Company makes contribution to defined contribution \npension plan. The contribution payable is recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. \nThe Company also makes contribution to defined benefit \npension and gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Service costs and net interest expense or income is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gain or Loss on account of remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. \nThe employees of the Company are entitled to compensated \nleave for which the Company records the liability based on actuarial valuation computed using projected unit credit method. These benefits are unfunded.1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Financial StatementsREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 157 ITC LimitedActual disbursements made under the Workers’ Voluntary \nRetirement Scheme are accounted as revenue expenses.\nEmployee\n\t\nShare\n\t\nBased\n\t\nCompensation\nStock\n\t\nOptions\nStock Options are granted to eligible employees under \nthe ITC Employee Stock Option Schemes (“ITC ESOS”),  \nas may be decided by the Nomination & Compensation Committee\n /\n Board. \nEligible employees for this purpose \ninclude employees of the Company including Directors and those on deputation and employees of the Company’s subsidiary companies including Managing Director\n /\n Wholetime Director of a subsidiary.\nUnder \nInd AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options) \nis recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on the grant date. \nWhile the fair value of Stock Options granted is recognised \nin the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Company (other than those out on deputation), the value of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to employees on deputation and to employees of the wholly owned and other subsidiary companies is considered as capital contribution\n /\n investment. \nThe \nCompany generally seeks reimbursement of the value \nof Stock Options from such companies, as applicable. It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide not to seek such reimbursements from: \n(a)\n Wholly \nowned subsidiaries who need to conserve \nfinancial capacity to sustain their business and growth \nplans and to address contingencies that may arise, taking into account the economic and market conditions then prevailing and opportunities and threats in the competitive context.\n(b)\n Other \ncompanies not covered under (a) above, who \nneed to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and where the quantum of reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores for each entity for a financial year.\nCash\n\t\nSettled\n\t\nStock\n\t\nAppreciation\n\t\nLinked\n\t\nReward\n\t \n(SAR)\n\t\nPlan\n\t\nCash \nSettled SAR units are granted to eligible employees \nunder the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”).

F or cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees, a \nliability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and \nis subsequently remeasured at each reporting period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Company. In case of employees on deputation to group companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company. The value of such payments, net of reimbursements, is considered as capital contribution\n /\n investment. \nLeases\nThe \nCompany assesses at contract inception whether a \ncontract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a \nlease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nCompany\n\t\nas\n\t\na\n\t\nLessee\nRight-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of \na contract or arrangement for significant lease components at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets on a straight line basis. Lease term is determined based on consideration of facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases and low value leases are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\nThe Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the \npresent value of lease payments to be made on the date of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of the lease term. The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value of \nthe ROU assets.1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Financial Statements158 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedCompany \tas\ta\tLessor\nLeases \nin which the Company does not transfer substantially \nall the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are \nclassified as operating leases. Where the Company is a lessor under an operating lease, the asset is capitalised within property, plant and equipment or investment property and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\nTaxes\n\t\non\n\t\nIncome\nTaxes on income comprise current taxes and deferred \ntaxes. Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period using tax rates and tax laws enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences \nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes (tax base), at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. \nDeferred tax assets are recognised for the future tax \nconsequences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\nIncome tax, insofar as it relates to items disclosed under \nother comprehensive income or equity, is disclosed separately under other comprehensive income or equity, as applicable.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is \nlegally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nClaims\nClaims against the Company not acknowledged as debts \nare disclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.Provisions\n \t\nProvisions \nare recognised when, as a result of a past \nevent, the Company has a legal or constructive obligation; \nit is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount so recognised is a best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\nIn an event when the time value of money is material, the \nprovision is carried at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation.\nOperating\n\t\nSegments\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent \nwith the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Corporate Management Committee. \nSegments are organised based on businesses which \nhave similar economic characteristics as well as exhibit similarities in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.\nSegment revenue arising from third party customers is \nreported on the same basis as revenue in the financial statements. Inter-segment revenue is reported on the basis of transactions which are primarily market led. Segment results represent profits before finance charges, unallocated corporate expenses and taxes. \n“Unallocated Corporate Expenses” include revenue and \nexpenses that relate to initiatives\n / c\nosts attributable to the \nenterprise as a whole.\nFinancial\n\t\nand\n\t\nManagement\n\t\nInformation\n\t\nSystems\nThe Company’s Accounting System is designed to unify \nthe Financial and Cost Records and also to comply with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, to provide financial and cost information appropriate to the businesses and facilitate Internal Contro l.Notes to the Financial Statements\n1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 159 ITC LimitedNotes to the Financial Statements\n2.\t Use\tof\testimates \tand\tjudgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity \nwith generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period end. Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \nan ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nA.\t Judgements\n\t\nin\n\t\napplying\n\t\naccounting\n\t\npolicies\nThe judgements, apart from those involving estimations \n(see note B below), that the Company has made in the process of applying its accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financial statements pertain to useful life of intangible assets. The Company is required to determine whether its intangible assets have indefinite or finite life which is a subject matter of judgement. Certain trademarks have been considered of having an indefinite useful life taking into account that there are no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or limitations under contract or law. Other trademarks have been amortised over their useful economic life. Refer notes to the financial statements. \nB.\t Key\n\t\nsources\n\t\nof\n\t\nestimation\n\t\nuncertainty\nThe following are the key assumptions concerning the \nfuture, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n 1.\t\tUseful\n\tlives\n\tof\n\tproperty,\n\tplant\n\tand\n\tequipment,\n\t\ninvestment\n\t\nproperty\n\t\nand\n\t\nintangible\n\t\nassets:\n \n  As \ndescribed in the significant accounting policies, \nthe Company reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period and the impact of changes in the estimated \nuseful life is considered in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n 2.\t\tFair\n\t\nvalue\n\t\nmeasurements\n\t\nand\n\t\nvaluation \t\nprocesses:\n \n  Some \nof the Company’s assets and liabilities \nare measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n 3.\t\tActuarial\n\t\nValuation:\n \n  The \ndetermination of Company’s liability towards \ndefined benefit obligation to employees is made through independent actuarial valuation including determination of amounts to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and in Other Comprehensive Income. Such valuation depends upon assumptions determined after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. Information about such valuation is provided in notes to the financial statements. \n 4.\t\tClaims,\n\t\nProvisions\n\t\nand\t\nContingent\n\t\nLiabilities:\n\t\n   The \nCompany has ongoing litigations with various \nregulatory authorities and third parties. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management’s assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements.160 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedNotes to the Financial Statements\n# Includes amounts transferred from Property, Plant and Equipment to Investment Property.  \n^\n Also refer Note 27(vii)(` in Crores)\n(` in Crores)ParticularsGross Block\n As at\n31st March,\n2021 AdditionsWithdrawals\nand\n adjustments  As at\n31st March,\n2022 AdditionsWithdrawals\nand\n adjustments  #As at\n31st March,\n2023 \n3A.

Such assets are also annually tested for impairment.\n These assets pertain to the ‘FMCG - Others’ Segment and are related to the Branded Packaged Foods and Personal Care Products bu\nsinesses of the Company.\n Impairment \ntesting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been carried out considering their recoverable amounts which, inter-alia, includes estimation of their value-in-use \nbased on management projections. These projections have been made for a period of five years, or longer, as applicable and consider various factors, such as market scenario, growth trends, growth \nand margin projections, and terminal growth rates specific to the business. \n For such projections, \ndiscount rate of 10% (2022 - 10%) and long-term growth rates ranging between 5% to 6% (2022 - 5% to 6%) have been considered. Discount rate has been determined \nconsidering the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of market benchmarks.\n Based on the above assessment, no impairment has been recognised during the year.\n2. b)\n Computer \nsoftware and Customer Relationships are amortized over a period of 5 years and 8 years respectively. Other Intangibles with finite useful life are amortized over a period of 10 years unless \nshorter useful life is required based on contractual or legal terms.\n3. \n The amortization expense of intangible assets has been included\n under ‘Depreciation and amortization expense’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n4. \n The amount of expenditure recognised in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is \n` 90.50 Crores (2022 - ` 147.39 Crores).\n5.

These \nPlans are administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable \nStatutes. The concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance. \n \n  Provident \nFund, Pension and Gratuity Benefits are funded and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined \nBenefit Pension Plans are based on employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits. \n \n (a)\t\nDefined\n\t\nBenefit\n\t\nPlans:\n \n   The \nliabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, \nprofessionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. The Company makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation. Some Group companies also participate in these Plans. These participating Group companies make contributions to the Plans for their respective employees on a uniform basis and each entity ascertains their obligation through actuarial valuation. The net Defined benefit cost is recognised by these companies in their respective Financial Statements.\n \n  Risk \nManagement\n \n   The \nDefined Benefit Plans expose the Company to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and \nsalary cost inflation risk. \n \n   Investment \nRisk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to \ncredit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds – the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements. \n \n   Interest \nRate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plan liability is determined using the discount rate based on the \nmarket yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa.\n \n   Salary \nCost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future \nsalaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities. \n \n   These \nPlans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is \ndesigned based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes.\n \n   The \nTrustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure \nthat the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation. 27.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements’ section \nof our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with \nthe ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements.\nKey Audit MattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \njudgement, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. \nWe have determined the matters described below to be \nthe key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone Ind AS financial statements.INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\nTo the Members of ITC LimitedIndependent Auditor’s Report\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 215 ITC LimitedKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nevaluation of performance. There is a risk of revenue \nbeing recorded before control is transferred. \nRefer Note 1 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial \nStatements - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 21A\n \n/\n \n21B.  Tested the effectiveness of such controls over revenue \ncut off at year-end. \n  On a sample basis, tested supporting documentation \nfor sales transactions recorded during the year which included sales invoices, customer contracts and shipping documents.\n  Performed an increased level of substantive testing \nin respect of sales transactions recorded during the period closer to the year end and subsequent to the year end.\n  Compared revenue with historical trends and where appropriate, conducted further enquiries and testing.\n  Assessed disclosures in financial statements in \nrespect of revenue, as specified in Ind AS 115.\nImpairment assessment of investment in WelcomHotels Lanka (Private) Limited (‘WLPL’), a wholly owned subsidiary\nWLPL is developing a mixed-use project in Colombo, \nSri Lanka which includes a hotel and a residential apartment complex. At March 31, 2023, the carrying value of Company’s investment in WLPL is INR 2,775.41 crores. The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are assessed annually by management for potential indicators of impairment.\nIn view of the deterioration in the macro-economic \nscenario in Sri Lanka, the Company has assessed the carrying value of investments basis evaluation of the recoverable value of the capital work in progress of the hotel (PPE) and inventory of the residential apartments being developed by WLPL. The said determination is based on assumptions, that by their nature imply the use of the management’s judgement, in particular with reference to forecast of future cash flows, selling price, balance cost to complete the project, selling costs, terminal value, long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to such forecasted cash flows. Considering the judgement required for estimating the cash flows and the assumptions used, this is considered as a key audit \n \nmatter.\nRefer Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Use of estimates and judgements to the Standalone Ind AS Financial StatementsOur audit procedures included the following:\n  Evaluated the key judgements  /  assumptions \nunderlying \nmanagement’s assessment of potential \nindicators of impairment.\n  Obtained and read the projections  /  estimated selling \nprice\n /\n future \ncashflows along with sensitivity analysis \nthereof of the underlying PPE and inventory at WLPL.\n  Discussed and obtained assessment of recoverable \nvalue of PPE and inventory from component auditor of WLPL.\n  Evaluated management’s methodology, assumptions \nand estimates used in these calculations.\n  Involved valuation specialist to review the \nappropriateness of methodology and key assumptions considered by management to determine discounted future cash flows.\n  Performed sensitivity analysi s around impact on \nfuture cash flows due to changes in key assumptions considered by management.\n  Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the future cash flow \nmodel including comparison with approved budgets.\n  Assessed the recoverability of investment with regard \nto underlying value in use of PPE and net realisable value of inventory in WLPL.216 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedIndependent Auditor’s Report\nWe have determined that there are no other key audit \nmatters to communicate in our report.\nInformation Other than the Financial Statements and \nAuditor’s Report Thereon\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \nother information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the standalone Ind AS financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\nOur opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements \ndoes not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. \nIn connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS \nfinancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Standalone \nInd AS Financial Statements\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies;  \nmaking judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; \nand the design, implementation and maintenance \nof adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the standalone Ind AS financial statements, \nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose Board of Directors are also responsible for \noverseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \nStandalone Ind AS Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section  \n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 217 ITC LimitedIndependent Auditor’s Report\n•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.

The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the relevant presentation requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Group adopted Ind AS from 1st April, 2016.\nBasis\n\t\nof\n\t\nPreparation\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with \nthe historical cost convention, except for certain items that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies.\nFair Value is the price that would be received to sell an \nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and\n /\n or disclosure \npurposes in \nthese consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 – Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 – Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in Ind AS 2 – Inventories or value in use in Ind AS 36 – Impairment of Assets.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity \nwith Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nBasis\n\t\nof\n\t\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) include the \nfinancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the share of the total comprehensive income \nof joint ventures and associates.\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Associates \nare entities over which the Group exercise significant influence but does not control. An entity\n /\n a\nrrangement in \nwhich the Group has the ability to exercise control jointly with one or more uncontrolled entities may be a joint venture (“JV”) or a joint operation (“JO”). Unlike in a JV where parties have proportionate interests in the assets and liabilities of the JV entity, parties have rights to and obligations towards specified assets and liabilities in a JO.\nControl, significant influence and joint control is assessed \nannually with reference to the voting power (usually arising from equity shareholdings and potential voting rights) and other rights (usually contractual) enjoyed by the Group in its capacity as an investor that provides it the power and consequential ability to direct the investee’s activities and significantly affect the Group’s returns from its investment. Such assessment requires the exercise of judgement and is disclosed by way of a note to the Financial Statements.  The Group is considered not to be in control of entities where it is unclear as to whether it enjoys such power over the investee.\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of subsidiaries \nare aggregated and consolidated, line by line, from the date control is acquired by any Group entity to the date it ceases. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the Group as owners and to the non-controlling interests. The Group presents the  \nnon-controlling interests in the Balance Sheet within equity, separately from the equity of the Group as owners. The excess of the Group’s investment in a subsidiary over its share in the net worth of such subsidiary on the date control is acquired is treated as goodwill while a deficit is considered as a capital reserve in the CFS. In case of JO, Group’s share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are consolidated.  On disposal of the subsidiary, attributable amount on goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss and recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss, if any, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as it arises and is not reversed.  For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs to which it relates, which is not larger than an operating segment, and is monitored for internal management purposes.\nAn investment in an associate or a JV is initially recognised \nat cost on the date of the investment, and inclusive of any goodwill\n /\n capital \nreserve embedded in the cost, in the REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 241 ITC Limited1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)\nBalance Sheet. The proportionate share of the Group in \nthe net profits\n /\n losses \nas also in the other comprehensive \nincome is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and the carrying value of the investment is adjusted by a like amount (referred as ‘equity method’).\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses \nand cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\nOperating\n\t\nCycle\nAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current or \nnon-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.\nProperty,\n\t\nPlant\n\t\nand\n\t\nEquipment\n\t\n–\n\t\nTangible\n\t\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost of \nacquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. For this purpose, cost includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of property, plant and equipment recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nCost is inclusive of inward freight, duties and taxes and \nincidental expenses related to acquisition. In respect  \nof major projects involving construction, related  \npre-operational expenses form part of the value of assets capitalised. Expenses capitalised also include applicable borrowing costs for qualifying assets, if any. All upgradation\n /  \nenhancement\ns are charged off as revenue expenditure \nunless they bring similar significant additional benefits.\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised \nupon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset.  \nAny gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nDepreciation of these assets commences when the assets \nare ready for their intended use which is generally on commissioning. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated in a manner that amortizes the cost (or other amount substituted for cost) of the assets after commissioning, less its residual value, over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 on a straight line basis. Land is not depreciated.The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment \nof the Group are as follows:\nBuildings 30-60 Years\nLeasehold Improvement Shorter of lease period or \nestimated useful lives\nPlant and Equipment 3-25 Years\nFurniture and Fixtures 8-10 YearsVehicles 8-10 Years\nOffice Equipment 5 Years\nAssets held under finance leases are depreciated over their \nexpected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.\nProperty, plant and equipment’s residual values and useful \nlives are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and changes, if any, are treated as changes in accounting estimate.\nGoodwill\n\t\non\n\t\nConsolidation\nGoodwill arising on consolidation is stated at cost less \nimpairment losses, where applicable. On disposal of a subsidiary, attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On acquisition of an associate or joint venture, the goodwill\n /\n capital \nreserve arising from \nsuch acquisition is included in the carrying amount of the investment and also disclosed separately.\nImpairment loss, if any, to the extent the carrying amount \nexceed the recoverable amount is charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as it arises and is not reversed. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs to which it relates, which is not larger than an operating segment, and is monitored for internal management purposes.\nIntangible\n\t\nAssets\nIntangible Assets that the Group controls and from which \nit expects future economic benefits, are capitalised upon acquisition and measured initially:\na.\n for \nassets acquired in a business combination, at fair \nvalue on the date of acquisition; \nb. for \nseparately acquired assets, at cost comprising \nthe purchase price (including import duties and  \nnon-refundable taxes) and directly attributable costs to \nprepare the asset for its intended use.\nInternally generated assets for which the cost is clearly identifiable are capitalised at cost.  Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised only after the technical and commercial Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements242 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limitedfeasibility of the asset for sale or use has been established. \nThereafter, all directly attributable expenditure incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use are recognised as the cost of such assets. Internally generated brands, websites and customer lists are not recognised as intangible assets.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets includes deemed \ncost which represents the carrying value of intangible assets recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP.\nThe useful life of an intangible asset is considered finite \nwhere the rights to such assets are limited to a specified period of time by contract or law (e.g. patents, licences, trademarks, franchise and servicing rights) or the likelihood of technical, technological obsolescence (e.g. computer software, design, prototypes) or commercial obsolescence (e.g. lesser known brands are those to which adequate marketing support may not be provided). If, there are no such limitations, the useful life is taken to be indefinite.\nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over \ntheir estimated useful lives by the straight line method unless it is practical to reliably determine the pattern of benefits arising from the asset. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized.\nAll intangible assets are tested for impairment. Amortization \nexpenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Thus, after initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and\n /\n or impairment\n \nlosses.\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to \ndetermine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.\nImpairment\n\t\nof\n\t\nAssets\nImpairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the \ncarrying amount of assets or cash generating units exceed their recoverable amount.\nRecoverable amount is higher of an asset’s net selling \nprice and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.\nImpairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed \nwhen there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised no longer exist or have decreased. Such \nreversals are recognised as an increase in carrying amounts of assets to the extent that it does not exceed the carrying amounts that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years.\nInvestment\n\t\nProperty\nProperties that are held for long-term rental yields and\n /\n or  \nfo\nr capital appreciation are classified as investment \nproperties. Investment properties are stated at cost of \nacquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortize the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated. \nTransfers to, or from, investment properties are made at \nthe carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use.\nAn item of investment property is derecognised upon \ndisposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nIncome received from investment property is recognised \nin the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable \nvalue. The cost is calculated on weighted average method. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to their present location and condition and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and sale.\nObsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are \nidentified from time to time and, where necessary,  \na provision is made for such inventories.\nForeign\n\t\nCurrency\n\t\nTransactions\nThe presentation currency of the Group is Indian Rupee. \nTransactions in foreign currency are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.  \nGains\n /\n l\nosses arising on settlement as also on translation \nof monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit \nand Loss.1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 243 ITC LimitedExchange differences arising on monetary items that, \nin substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation (having a functional currency other than Indian Rupee) are accumulated in foreign currency translation reserve.\nFor the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:(a)\n asset\ns and liabilities of foreign operations, together \nwith goodwill and fair value adjustments assumed on \nacquisition thereof, are translated to Indian Rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period end;\n(b)\n income and expense items are translated at the\n \naverage exchange rates prevailing during the period; when exchange rates fluctuate significantly the rates prevailing on the transaction date are used instead.\nDifferences arising on such translation are accumulated in foreign currency translation reserve and attributed to  \nnon-controlling interests proportionately.\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the exchange \ndifferences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss. In relation to a partial disposal, that does not result in losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate exchange differences accumulated in equity is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nDerivatives and Hedge Accounting\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are \nsubsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains\n /\n losses are\n \nrecognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the resulting  \ngain\n /\n loss is recognised as per the hedge accounti\nng  \nprinciples stated below.\nThe Group complies with the principles of hedge accounting \nwhere derivative contracts and\n /\n or \nnon-derivative financial \nassets\n /\n l\niabilities that are permitted under applicable \naccounting standards are designated as hedging instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\n(i)\n Fair value he\ndges\n Changes in fair value of the designated portion of\n \nhedging instruments that qualify as fair value hedges \nare recognised in profit or loss immediately, together \nwith any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The \nchange in the fair value of the designated portion of hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.\n Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging\n \ninstrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.\n(ii)\n Cash flow he\ndges\n The effective portion of changes in the fair value of\n \nhedging instrument that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedge Reserve’. The gains\n /\n losses relating \nto the \nineffective portion are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n Amounts \npreviously recognised and accumulated in \nother comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such gains\n /\n losses are transferred from equity (but not as\n \nreclassification adjustment) and included in the initial measurement cost of the non-financial asset.\n Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging\n \ninstrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gains\n / losses recognised in\n \nother comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remain in equity and is reclassified when the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains\n / losses accumulat\ned in equity are \nrecognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nInvestment in Associate and Joint Venture\nInvestment in associate and joint venture is accounted for \nusing the ‘equity method’ less accumulated impairment,  \nif any.\nFinancial Instrument, Financial Assets, Financial \nLiabilities and Equity Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised \nwhen the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and are initially 1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements244 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limitedmeasured at fair value except for trade receivables that do \nnot contain a significant financing component, which are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition of financial assets or financial liabilities. Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date when the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\nFinancial\n\t\nAssets\nRecognition:  Financial assets include Investments, Trade \nreceivables, Advances, Security deposits, Cash and cash \nequivalents. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value or transaction price, as applicable, when the Group becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction price includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nClassification: Management determines the classification \nof an asset at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on such classification.\nFinancial assets are classified as those measured at: (a)\n amort\nised cost, where the financial assets are held \nsolely for collection of cash flows arising from payments \nof principal and\n /\n or interest.\n(\nb) f\nair value through other comprehensive income \n(FVTOCI), where the financial assets are held not only for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest but also from the sale of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. \n(c)\n fair \nvalue through profit or loss (FVTPL), where the \nassets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions based on the fair value of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\nTrade receivables, Advances, Security deposits, Cash and cash equivalents etc. are classified for measurement at amortised cost while investments may fall under any of the aforesai d classes. However, in respect of particular \ninvestments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made to present subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.\nImpairment: The Group assesses at each reporting date \nwhether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) such as Investments, Trade receivables, Advances and Security deposits held at amortised cost and financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are tested for impairment based on evidence or information that is available without undue cost or effort. Expected credit losses are assessed and loss allowances recognised if the credit quality of the financial asset has deteriorated significantly since initial recognition. \nReclassification: When and only when the business \nmodel is changed, the Group shall reclassify all affected financial assets prospectively from the reclassification date as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss without restating the previously recognised gains, losses or interest and in terms of the reclassification principles laid down in the Ind AS relating to Financial Instruments.\nDerecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when \nthe right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Concomitantly, if the asset is one that is measured at:\n(a)\n amortised \ncost, the gain or loss is recognised in the \nStatement of Profit and Loss;\n(b) f\nair value through other comprehensive income, the \ncumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to \nreserves are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset represents an equity investment, in which case the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified within equity.\nIncome\n\tRecognition:  \nInterest income is recognised in the \nStatement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive dividend is established.\nFinancial\n\t\nLiabilities\nBorrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities \nare initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently 1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 245 ITC Limitedmeasured at amortised cost. Any discount or premium on \nredemption\n /\n settlement is recognised in the Statement of\n \nProfit and Loss as finance cost over the life of the liability using the effective interest method and adjusted to the liability figure disclosed in the Balance Sheet.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability  \nis extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is \ndischarged, cancelled or on expiry.\nOffsetting\n\t\nFinancial\n\t\nInstruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount \nis included in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nEquity\n\t\nInstruments\nEquity instruments are recognised at the value of the \nproceeds, net of direct costs of the capital issue.\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured at the transaction price that the \nCompany receives or expects to receive as consideration for goods supplied and services rendered, net of returns and estimates of variable consideration such as discounts to customers. Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duties and National Calamity Contingent Duty which are payable on manufacture of goods but excludes taxes such as VAT and Goods and Services Tax which are payable in respect of sale of goods and services.\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised \nwhen the Group performs its obligations to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery and in case of services, in the period in which such services are rendered.\nGovernment\n\t\nGrant\nGroup entities may receive government grants that  \nrequire compliance with certain conditions related to the \nentity’s operating activities or are provided to the entity  \nby way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria.\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is \nreasonable assurance that the grant will be received upon the Group entity complying with the conditions attached to the grant. Accordingly, government grants:\n(a)\n related \nto or used for assets, are deducted from the \ncarrying amount of the asset. (b) related to incurring specific expenditures are taken to \nthe Statement of Profit and Loss on the same basis and in the same periods as the expenditures incurred.\n(c)\n by \nway of financial assistance on the basis of certain \nqualifying criteria are recognised as they become receivable. \nIn the unlikely event that a grant previously recognised is ultimately not received, it is treated as a change in estimate and the amount cumulatively recognised is expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nDividend\n\t\nDistribution\nDividends paid (including income tax thereon) are \nrecognised in the period in which the interim dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, or in respect of the final dividend when approved by shareholders.\nEmployee\n\t\nBenefits\nThe Group makes contributions to both defined benefit \nand defined contribution schemes which are mainly administered through duly constituted and approved Trusts.\nProvident Fund contributions are in the nature of defined \ncontribution scheme. In respect of employees who are members of constituted and approved trusts, the Group recognises contribution payable to such trusts as an expense including any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investment and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India. In respect of other employees, provident funds are deposited with the Government and recognised as expense.\nThe Group makes contribution to defined contribution \npension plan. The contribution payable is recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. \nThe Group also makes contribution to defined benefit \npension and gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Service costs and net interest expense or income is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gain or Loss on account of remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\nThe employees of the Group are entitled to compensated \nleave for which the Group records the liability based on actuarial valuation computed using projected unit credit method. These benefits are unfunded.\nActual disbursements made under the Workers’ Voluntary \nRetirement Scheme are accounted as revenue expenses.1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements246 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedEmployee \tShare\tBased\tCompensation\nStock\n\t\nOptions\nStock Options are granted to eligible employees under \nthe ITC Employee Stock Option Schemes (“ITC ESOS”), as may be decided by the Nomination & Compensation Committee\n / Board.\n Eligible employees for this purpose \ninclude employees of the Group entities, their Directors and those on deputation to joint ventures and associates.\nUnder Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options) \nis recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on the grant date.\nWhile the fair values of Stock Options granted is recognised \nin the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Group (other than those out on deputation), the value of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to  \nemployees on deputation is considered as capital contribution\n /\n investment.\nThe \nGroup generally seeks reimbursement of the value \nof Stock Options from such companies, as applicable. It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide not to seek such reimbursements in respect of value of Stock Options from such companies, who need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth  \nplans and where the quantum of reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores for each \nentity for a financial year.\nCash\n\t\nSettled\n\t\nStock\n\t\nAppreciation\n\t\nLinked\n\t\nReward\n\t \n(SAR)\n\t\nPlan\nCash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees \nunder the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees for this purpose are such present and future permanent employees of the Company, including a Director of the Company, as may be decided by the CMC\n /\n Nomination \n& \nCompensation Committee\n /\n Board.\nFor \ncash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees, a \nliability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the Group. In case of employees on deputation to group companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company. The value of such payments, net of reimbursements, is considered as capital contribution\n /\n \ninvestment.Leases\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a \ncontract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup\n\t\nas\n\t\na\n\t\nLessee\nRight-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of \na contract or arrangement for significant lease components at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets on a straight line basis. Lease term is determined based on consideration of facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases and low value leases are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\nThe Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the \npresent value of lease payments to be made on the date of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of the lease term. The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value of the ROU assets.\nGroup\n\t\nas\n\t\na\n\t\nLessor\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially \nall the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Where the Group is a lessor under an operating lease, the asset is capitalised within property, plant and equipment or investment property and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 247 ITC Limited1.\t Significant \tAccounting \tPolicies \t(Contd.)\nTaxes\ton\tIncome\nTaxes \non income comprise current taxes and deferred \ntaxes. Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is \nprovided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period using tax rates and tax laws enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. \nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences \nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes (tax base), at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for the future tax \nconsequences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\nIncome tax, insofar as it relates to items disclosed under \nother comprehensive income or equity, is disclosed separately under other comprehensive income or equity, as applicable.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is \nlegally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nClaims\nClaims against the Group not acknowledged as debts are \ndisclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognised when, as a result of a past \nevent, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably \nestimated. The amount so recognised is a best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\nIn an event when the time value of money is material, the \nprovision is carried at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation.\nOperating\n\t\nSegments\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent \nwith the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Corporate Management Committee.\nSegments are organised based on businesses which \nhave similar economic characteristics as well as exhibit similarities in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.\nSegment revenue arising from third party customers is \nreported on the same basis as revenue in the financial statements. Inter-segment revenue is reported on the basis of transactions which are primarily market led. Segment results represent profits before finance charges, unallocated corporate expenses and taxes.\n“Unallocated Corporate Expenses” include revenue and \nexpenses that relate to initiatives\n / c\nosts attributable to the \nenterprise as a whole.\nFinancial\n\t\nand\n\t\nManagement\n\t\nInformation\n\t\nSystems\nThe Group’s Accounting System is designed to unify the \nFinancial and Cost Records and also to comply with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, to provide financial and cost information appropriate to the businesses and facilitate Internal C ontrol.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements248 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedThe preparation of financial statements in conformity \nwith generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period end. Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \nan ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nA.\n\t\nJudgements\n\t\nin\n\t\napplying\n\t\naccounting\n\t\npolicies\nThe following are the judgements, apart from those involving \nestimations (see note B below), that the Group have made in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:\n1. \n Control:\n The \nGroup assessed whether or not it has control on its \ninvestees based on whether, as an investor, it has the \npower\n /\n rights and consequently \nthe practical ability to \ndirect the relevant activities of its investees unilaterally. In making this judgement, the Group considered the absolute size of its holding, the relative size of and dispersion of other shareholders, and whether any contractual arrangements exist between the Company (and its subsidiaries) and other shareholders of the investees. Based on this, and in accordance with its Accounting Policy, the Group has determined that the entities listed in the notes to the financial statements are the only entities over which Group has control.\n The \nCompany is a settlor for certain trusts, i.e., ITC \nSangeet Research Academy, ITC Education Trust and ITC Rural Development Trust. The Group while considering the nature and insignificant variability of its return has concluded that it does not ‘control’ these trusts.\n2.\n Sign\nificant\n\t\ninfluence: \n The \nGroup assessed whether or not it has significant \ninfluence on its investees based on its practical ability to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, though it is not in control or in joint control of these policies. Based on such assessment, the Group determined that the entities listed in the notes to the financial statements are the only entities \nover which the Group has significant influence, and accordingly associates. \n3.\n Joint\n\t\nControl:\n(i)\n The \nGroup holds 50% of the equity share capital \nof Maharaja Heritage Resorts Limited, a company involved in operation of hotel properties. The Group do not consider that it is able to exercise control over the company as the decisions about relevant activities of the company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 50% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.\n(ii)\n The \nGroup holds 26% of the equity share capital of \nEspirit Hotels Private Limited, a company involved in development of a luxury hotel complex. The Group has considered that in view of the shareholder agreement, key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 74% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.\n(iii)\n The \nGroup holds 27.90% of the equity share capital \nof Logix Developers Private Limited, a company intended for the purpose of developing a luxury hotel-cum-service apartment complex. The Group has concluded that the key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 72.10% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.\n(iv)\n The \nGroup holds 50% of the equity share capital \nof ITC Essentra Limited, a company involved in manufacture and sale of filter rods. The Group has concluded that the key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 50% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.\n4.\t Useful\n\t\nlife\n\t\nof\n\t\nIntangible\n\t\nAssets:\n The \nGroup is required to determine whether its \nintangible assets have indefinite or finite life which is a subject matter of judgement. Certain trademarks have been considered of having an indefinite useful life taking into account that there are no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or limitations under contract or law. Other trademarks have been amortized over their useful economic life.

In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to  the financial statements.3.\t Actuarial\n \t Valuation:\n The \ndetermination of Group’s liability towards defined \nbenefit obligation to employees is made through \nindependent actuarial valuation including determination of amounts to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and in Other Comprehensive Income. Such valuation depends upon assumptions determined after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. Information about such valuation is provided in notes to the financial statements. \n4.\t Claims,\n\t\nProvisions\n\t\nand\n\t\nContingent\n\t\nLiabilities:\n The \nGroup has ongoing litigations with various regulatory \nauthorities and third parties.

Additional N otes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n     In respect of Surya Nepal Private Limited (SNPL), Excise, Income Tax and VAT authorities issued Show Cause Notices \n(SCNs) and raised demands to recover taxes for different years on theoretical production of cigarettes. In all these proceedings, the authorities applied an input-output ratio allegedly submitted by SNPL in the year 1990-91 and arrived at a theoretical production and demanded tax\n /\n duty \non the differential production\n /\n turnover. \nThis, despite the fact that SNPL’s \ncigarette factory was under ‘physical control’ of the Excise authorities and cigarettes produced were duly accounted for and certified as such by the Excise authorities.\n \n    The \nRevenue Authorities for the first time raised excise demands for the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95, claiming \nthat SNPL could have produced more cigarettes according to the input-output ratio submitted in the year 1990-91. SNPL challenged these excise demands before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal through a writ petition. A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal decided the matter in favour of SNPL (the “Division Bench Judgement”) and rejected the above basis of theoretical production. The Ministry of Finance of Nepal filed a review petition before the Full Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal seeking review of the judgement of Division Bench. The Full Bench after hearing both the sides at length upheld the judgement of Division Bench by its order dated October 29, 2009. \n \n    Similar \ndemands had been raised for other financial years viz., Excise Demands for FY 1998-99 to FY 2002-03 and \nIncome Tax demand for FY 2001-02, which were also challenged by SNPL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal by way of writ petitions and the Court was pleased to allow all the writ petitions setting aside the demands. \n \n    Further, the Inland Revenue \nDepartment had decided administrative review petitions in favour of SNPL setting aside Value \nAdded Tax demands for the financial years 2001-02 and 2007-08 and Income Tax demand for the FY 2005-06 following the aforesaid decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal. \n \n    During \nthe pendency of the aforementioned review petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal and thereafter, the \nRevenue Authorities raised demands and issued a SCN, in the same subject matter of theoretical production for different years (as listed below), which were also challenged by SNPL by way of writ petitions before Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal between the years 2007 to 2010: \n \n   1.\n  Excise \ndemand letters for ` 17.38 Crores [Nepalese Rupee (NRs.) 27.80 Crores] relating to the financial years 2003-04 \nto 2006-07.\n \n   2.\n  Excise Show C\nause Notice for ` 12.28 Crores (NRs. 19.65 Crores) relating to the financial year 2007-08.\n \n   3.\n  Value \nAdded Tax (VAT) demand letters for ` 10.93 Crores (NRs. 17.49 Crores) relating to financial years 2002-03 to \n2006-07. \n \n   4.\n Income Tax demand letters for \n` 13.45 Crores (NRs. 21.52 Crores) relating to financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04.\n \n    SNPL’s writ petition\ns with regard to various tax demands and a SCN mentioned hereinabove were disposed of by the \nHon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal on 15th April, 2021 holding that SNPL should avail the alternate remedy by way of appeal to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). SNPL is currently pursuing legal remedy in line with the observations\n /\n directions \nprovided in the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal. \n \n    The \nManagement considers that all the demands listed above have no legal or factual basis; accordingly, the Management \nis of the view that there is no liability that is likely to arise, particularly in light of the fact that the issue underlying these demands has already been settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal in favour of SNPL.\n \n    No \nlegal recourse is required to be pursued in respect of a Show Cause Notice relating to the financial year 2007-08, since \nno demand has been issued.\n \n   It \nis not practicable for the Group to estimate the closure of these issues and the consequential timings of cash flows, if any, \nin respect of the above.\n284 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limited28.

These Consolidated Financial \nStatements include the obligations as per requirement of this standard except for those subsidiaries which are incorporated outside \nIndia who have determined the valuation\n /\n provision \nfor employee benefits as per requirements of their respective countries. In the \nopinion of the management, the impact of this deviation is not considered material.\n \n Description of Plans\n \n  The \nGroup makes contributions to both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans for qualifying employees. These Plans \nare administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable Statutes.  \nThe concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance.\n \n  Provident \nFund and Pension Benefits are funded, Gratuity Benefits are both funded as well unfunded; and Leave Encashment \nBenefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits. \n \n (a)\t\nDefined\n\t\nBenefit\n\t\nPlans:\n\t\n   As \nper Actuarial Valuations as on 31st March, 2023 and recognised in the financial statements in respect of Employee Benefit \nSchemes:\n \n  The \nliabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally \nqualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method as at year end. The Group makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation.\n \n Risk \nManagement\n \n  The \nDefined Benefit Plans expose the Group to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary \ncost inflation risk. \n \n  Investment \nRisk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit \nlosses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds – the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements. \n \n  Interest \nRate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plans liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market \nyields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa.\n \n  Salary \nCost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries \nof participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities. \n \n  These \nPlans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is \ndesigned based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes.\n \n  The \nTrustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that \nthe health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation. \nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 285 ITC Limited28.

These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation. While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the asset value changes may offset the impact to some extent. For presenting the sensitivities, the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the Defined Benefit Obligation presented above. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the Sensitivity Analysis from previous year.\n (` in Crores)\n DBO \t as \t at \t 31st \t March, \t 2023 DBO \t as \t at \t 31st \t March, \t 2022\n1 Discount Rate + 100 basis points 1530.08 1491.38\n2 Discount Rate - 100 basis points 1715.52 1678.51\n3 Salary Increase Rate + 1% 1708.10 1669.68\n4 Salary Increase Rate – 1% 1533.68 1493.21\n\t \t \t Maturity\n\t\nAnalysis\n\t\nof\n\t\nthe\n\t\nBenefit\n\t\nPayments\n1 Year 1 244.36 259.19\n2 Year 2 236.41 179.57\n3 Year 3 219.34 196.14\n4 Year 4 210.04 199.15\n5 Year 5 145.67 179.46\n6 Next 5 Years 595.80 528.13\n \n (b)\n  Amounts \ntowards Defined Contribution Plans have been recognised under “Contribution to Provident and other funds” in Note \n24: - ` 211.50 Crores (2022 - ` 167.45 Crores).\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 289 ITC Limited28.

However, Logix Estates Private Limited, Noida, the JV partner communicated its intention to explore alternative development plans to which the Company reiterated that it was committed only to the project as envisaged in the JVA. The JV partner refused to progress the project and instead expressed its intent to exit the JV by selling its stake to the Company and subsequently proposed that both parties should find a third party to sell the entire shareholding in LDPL. The resultant deadlock has stalled the project. The Company’s petition that the affairs of the JV are being conducted in a manner that is prejudicial to the interest of the Company and the JV entity, as also a petition for winding up of LDPL filed by Logix Estates, are currently before the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal. \n   New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA), vide letter dated 6th July, 2022, cancelled the sub-lease for the land on \nwhich the project was to be constructed on account of non-payment of lease instalments and non-fulfilment of the conditions of the sub-lease, including forfeiture of the amount deposited. Upon cancellation of the sub-lease, LDPL is evaluating all options to pursue its rights. Consequently, as a matter of prudence, LDPL had de-recognised the leasehold land\n /\n assets \nas well as \nadjusted\n /\n reversed the lease liabilities towards NOIDA in accordance with the terms of the sub-lease, as an adjusting event \nin \nterms of Ind AS 10 – “Events after the Reporting Period” while approving its financial statements for the year ended 31st \nMarch 2022, on 29th September, 2022. \n   As the accounting treatment pertaining to the aforesaid event was given effect to by LDPL in its financial statements for \nthe year ended 31st March, 2022 subsequent to the approval of the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31st March, 2022, the consequential impact has been considered in these consolidated financial statements.\n \n The financial statements of LDPL for the year ended 31s\nt March, 2023 are yet to be approved by its Board of Directors.\n (x)\n  The \nCompany on 27th October, 2022 acquired, in the third tranche, 1000 Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares of  \n` 10\n /\n - \neach of Mother Sparsh Baby Care Private Limited (Mother Sparsh), consequent to which the Company’s \nshareholding in Mother Sparsh aggregated 22.00% of its share capital on a fully diluted basis.

The \nfollowing explains the objectives and processes of the Company, being the largest component of the Group: The Company has a system-based approach to risk management, anchored to policies and procedures and internal financial controls aimed at ensuring early identification, evaluation and management of key financial risks (such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) that may arise as a consequence of its business operations as well as its investing and financing activities. Accordingly, the Company’s risk management framework has the objective of ensuring that such risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent manner and in compliance with applicable regulation. It also seeks to drive accountability in this regard. \n \n Liquidity Risk\n \n  The Group’s Current assets aggregate `\n 39670.89 Crores (2022 - ` 34232.45 Crores) including Current Investments,  \nCash and cash equivalents and Other Bank Balances of ` 22113.05 Crores (2022 - ` 16918.70 Crores) against an aggregate  \nCurrent liabilities of ` 13739.41 Crores (2022 - ` 12163.71 Crores). As part of its surplus liquidity management operations, the Group may sell instruments that are held at amortised cost. Such sales may be infrequent (even if significant in value) or insignificant  \nin value both individually and in aggregate (even if frequent). During the year, the net loss arising on such sale amounted to  \n` 49.13 Crores (2022 - Nil) (Refer Note 23).\n \n  Other Non-current liabilities \nother than lease liabilities due between one year to three years amounted to ` 304.94 Crores  \n(2022 - ` 112.94 Crores) and Other Non-current liabilities due after three years amounted to ` 115.42 Crores (2022 - ` 36.41 Crores) on the reporting date. The maturity analysis of undiscounted lease liabilities are disclosed under Note 28 (xi).\n \n  Further, \nwhile the Group’s total equity stands at ` 69538.79 Crores (2022 - ` 62821.87 Crores), it has non-current borrowings of \n` 3.49 Crores (2022 - ` 4.85 Crores). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the Group may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they become due does not exist. \n \n Market \nRisk\n \n  The \nGroup is not an active investor in equity markets; it holds certain investments in equity for long term value accretion which are \naccordingly measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The value of investments in such equity instruments  \nas at 31st March, 2023 is ` 1723.70 Crores (2022 - ` 1615.07 Crores). Accordingly, fair value fluctuations arising from market volatility is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. \n002 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2021 ITC Limited 306 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limited31. Financial Ins truments and Related Disclosures (Contd.)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n   As the Group is virtually debt-free and its deferred payment liabilities do not carry interest, the exposure to interest rate risk from \nthe perspective of financial liabilities is negligible. \n \n  The \nGroup’s investments are predominantly held in bonds\n /\n debentures, \nfixed deposits, certificate of deposits and debt mutual \nfunds. Mark to market movements in respect of the Group’s investments in bonds\n /\n debentures that \nare held at amortised cost \nare temporary and get recouped through coupon accruals. Other investments in bonds\n /\n debentures, \ncertificate of deposits are \nfair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss to recognise market volatility, which is not considered to be significant. Fixed \ndeposits are held with highly rated banks and companies and have a short tenure and are not subject to interest rate volatility. \n \n  The Group \nalso invests in mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses. Such investments are susceptible to market price risk \nthat arise mainly from changes in interest rate which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the mutual fund schemes in which the Group has invested, such price risk is not significant. \n \n  For select agricultural \ncommodities primarily held for trading, futures contracts are used to hedge price risks till positions in \nthe physical market are matched. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to the extent of fair value movement of the risk being hedged. Such hedges are generally for short time horizons and recognised in profit or loss within the crop cycle and are managed by the business within the approved policy framework. Accordingly, the Group’s net exposure to commodity price risk is considered to be insignificant.\n \n Foreign currency risk\n \n  The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currency (mainly US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese\n  \nYen) which are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including the Group’s net investments in foreign operations (with a functional currency other than Indian Rupee), are also subject  \nto reinstatement risks. \n \n  The carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated \nfinancial assets and liabilities including derivative contracts (other than in \nfunctional currency), are as follows: \n (\n` in Crores)\nAs at 31st March, 2023 USD Euro GBP JPY Others Total\nFinancial Assets 1010.94 312.50 66.24 0.27 87.88 1477.83\nFinancial Liabilities 129.94 32.56 2.44 8.24 7.17 180.35\nAs at 31st March, 2022 USD Euro GBP JPY Others Total\nFinancial Assets 1035.99 181.07 155.30 0.01 92.67 1465.04\nFinancial Liabilities 151.30 57.42 26.84 18.26 18.78 272.60\n \n   The Group uses foreign exchange forward, futures and options contracts to hedge its exposures in foreign currency arising from firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions. \n \n  a.\n Forward exchange contracts that were outstanding on\n respective reporting dates: \n (In Million)\nDesignated under Hedge Accounting As at 31st March, 2023 As at 31st March, 2022\nCurrency Cross Currency Buy Sell Buy Sell\nUS Dollar Indian Rupee 47.55 125.68 22.38 586.94\nEuro US Dollar 41.94 – 14.09 –\nCHF US Dollar – – 1.16 –\nGBP US Dollar – – 0.01 –\nSEK US Dollar – – 1.36 –\nSGD US Dollar – – 0.04 –\nJPY US Dollar 123.81 – 324.36 –\n The aforesaid\n hedges have a maturity of less than 1 year from the year end.\n \nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2021 003 ITC Limited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 307 ITC Limited31.

Within the Group, derivative instruments are largely entered \ninto by the Company and a subsidiary. The Company and the aforesaid subsidiary has established risk management policies \nto hedge the volatility in cashflows arising from exchange rate fluctuations in respect of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions, through foreign exchange forward, futures, options contracts and certain non-derivative financial liabilities. The proportion of forecast transactions that are to be hedged is decided based on the size of the forecast transaction and market conditions. As the counterparty for such transactions are primarily highly rated banks or recognised exchange(s), the risk of their non-performance is considered to be insignificant. Where derivatives are not designated under hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of such hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n \n  The \nCompany and one of its subsidiary has designated certain hedges which are entered to manage the volatility in cashflows \nas a cash flow hedge under hedge accounting. The currency, amount and tenure of such hedges are generally matched to the underlying transaction(s). Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised as cash flow hedging reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. While the probability of such hedges becoming ineffective is very low, the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n002 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2021 ITC Limited 308 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limited31.

The following explains the processes followed by the Company, \nbeing the largest component of the Group, to manage its credit risk: Company’s deployment in debt instruments are primarily in Government securities, fixed deposits with highly rated banks and companies; bonds issued by government institutions, public sector undertakings, mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses and certificate of deposits issued by highly rated banks and financial institutions. As these counter parties are Central\n /\n State \nGovernment, Government institutions\n /\n public \nsector undertakings \nwith investment grade\n /\n sovereign \ncredit ratings and taking into account the experience of the Company over time, the counter \nparty risk attached to such assets is considered to be insignificant. \n \n  The Group’s investments th\nat are held at amortised cost stood at ` 16422.36 Crores (2022 - ` 18598.99 Crores). \n \n  The Company’s customer base is large \nand diverse limiting the risk arising out of credit concentration. Further, credit is extended \nin business interest in accordance with guidelines issued centrally and business-specific credit policies that are consistent with such guidelines. Exceptions are managed and approved by appropriate authorities, after due consideration of the counterparty’s credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. The Company’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognized, where considered appropriate by responsible management.\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2021 003 ITC Limited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 309 ITC Limited31.

If significant \ninputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2021 003 ITC Limited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 311 ITC Limited   Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward \nrates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable. The fair value of \ninvestment in Bonds\n /\n Debentures, \nCertificate of Deposits, Venture Capital funds etc. and financial liabilities, where applicable, is \ndetermined using market observable inputs such as quotes from market participants, value published by the issuer etc.\n \n  Level \n3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n \n  If \none or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally \naccepted methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparty. \n \n  The \nfair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other Current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the \ncarrying amounts of these items due to their short-term nature. Where such items are Non-current in nature, the same has been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value.\n \n  There \nhas been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Group has not classified any \nmaterial financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact on their value.

We \nhave fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\nTo the Members of ITC Limited\nKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from the sale of goods (hereinafter referred to \nas “Revenue”) is recognised when the Group performs its obligation to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such revenue recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery. Our audit procedures included the following:\n  Assessed the Group’s revenue recognition accounting \npolicies in line with Ind AS 115 (“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”) and tested thereof. \n  Evaluated the integrity of the general information \nand technology control environment and testing the operating effectiveness of key IT application controls over recognition of revenue.\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 313 ITC LimitedKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nThe timing of revenue recognition is relevant to the \nreported performance of the Group. The management considers revenue as a key measure for evaluation of performance. There is a risk of revenue being recorded before control is transferred.\nRefer Note 1 to the Consolidated Ind AS Financial \nStatements - Significant Accounting Policies and  \nNote 22A\n /\n 22B.  Evaluated the design, implementation and operating \neffectiveness of Group’s controls in respect of revenue recognition.\n  Tested the effectiveness of such controls over \nrevenue cut off at year-end.\n  On a sample basis, tested supporting documentation \nfor sales transactions recorded during the year which included sales invoices, customer contracts and shipping documents.\n  Performed an increased level of substantive testing \nin respect of sales transactions recorded during the period closer to the year end and subsequent to the year end.\n  Compared revenue with historical trends and where \nappropriate, conducted further enquiries and testing.\n  Assessed disclosures in financial statements in \nrespect of revenue, as specified in Ind AS 115.\nImpairment assessment of Capital Work in Progress (Hotel) and valuation of Inventories (Residential \nApartments) of WelcomHotels Lanka (Private) Limited (‘WLPL’), a wholly owned subsidiary\nWLPL is developing a mixed-use project in Colombo, \nSri Lanka which includes a hotel and a residential apartment complex.

In view of the deterioration in the macro - economic scenario in Sri Lanka,  \nthe management of WLPL has performed impairment assessment for its capital work in progress of the  \nHotel (PPE) and net realisable value assessment for  \nthe inventory of the residential apartments. \nThe processes and methodologies for assessing and \ndetermining the recoverable value of the project are  \nbased on assumptions, that by their nature imply the  \nuse of the management’s judgement, in particular with  \nreference to forecast of future cash flows, selling price,  \nbalance cost to complete the project, selling costs,  \nterminal value, long-term growth rates and discount  \nrates applied to such forecasted cash flows. Considering the judgement required for estimating the cash flows  \nand the assumptions used, this is considered as a key audit matter.\nRefer Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and  \nNote 2 - Use of estimates and judgements to the \nConsolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.Our audit procedures included the following:\n  Obtained understanding of the Company’s policy on \nassessment of impairment of PPE and determination of net realisable value for inventory and assumptions used by the management including design and implementation of controls. \n  Obtained and read the projections  /  estimated selling \nprice\n /\n future \ncashflows along with sensitivity analysis \nthereof. \n  Discussed and obtained assessment of recoverable \nvalue of PPE and inventory from component auditor.\n  Evaluated management’s methodology, assumptions \nand estimates used in the calculations.\n  Involved valuation specialist to review the \nappropriateness of methodology and key assumptions considered by management to determine discounted future cash flows.\n  Performed sensitivity analysis around impact on \nfuture cash flows due to changes in key assumptions considered by management.\n  Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the future cash flow \nmodel including comparison with approved budgets.\n  Assessed the recoverability of PPE with regard to the \nvalue in use and net realisable value of inventory.Independent Auditor’s Report\n314 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC LimitedInformation Other than the Financial Statements and \nAuditor’s Report Thereon\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible \nfor the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\nOur opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial \nstatements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. \nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS \nfinancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is \nresponsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group including its associates and joint ventures  in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and  joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its associates and  joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable \nand prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that \nwere operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\nIn preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, \nthe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies \nincluded in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \nConsolidated Ind AS Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit Independent Auditor’s Report\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 315 ITC Limitedprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n•\n Obtain \nan understanding of internal control relevant to \nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i)  \nof the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n•\n Evaluate \nthe appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. \n•\n Conclude \non the appropriateness of management’s use \nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern. \n•\n Evaluate \nthe overall presentation, structure and content \nof the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \n•\n Obtain \nsufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding \nthe financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures of which we are the independent auditors \nand whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial \nstatements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during  \nour audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance \nwith a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged \nwith governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters.  \nWe describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,  \nwe determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nOther Matter\n(a)\n We \ndid not audit the financial statements and other \nfinancial information, in respect of twenty-two \nsubsidiaries, whose financial statements include total assets of ` 6,521.59 crores as at March 31, 2023,  \nand total revenues of ` 3,274.91 crores and net \ncash inflows of ` 177.51 crores for the year ended Independent Auditor’s Report\n316 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 ITC Limitedon that date.

Pr ovide the Processes for Consultation between \nStakeholders and the Board on Economic, Environmental, and Social Topics or if Consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such Consultations provided to the Board.\nITC believes that an effective stakeholder engagement \nprocess is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal of inclusive growth. In this context, the Company has laid down a four layered mechanism to deal with the aspect of stakeholder engagement. \nThe Board, through the CSR and Sustainability \nCommittee, inter alia, reviews, monitors and provides strategic direction to the Company’s CSR and sustainability practices towards fulfilling its Triple Bottom Line objectives. Half-yearly reports on the progress made by the Company in this regard are placed by the CMC before the CSR and Sustainability Committee. The CMC in turn has constituted the Sustainability Compliance Review Committee,REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023\nBusiness Responsibility \nand Sustainability Report\nXXVIIIcomprising of senior members of management, which \nevaluates and monitors compliance with the Policies formulated in this connection. The SCRC places a quarterly report on the subject before the CMC.\n2.\n Whether St\nakeholder Consultation is used to \nSupport the Identification and Management of \nEnvironmental, and Social Topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.\nYes, the Company believes that an effective stakeholder \nengagement process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal of inclusive growth. Accordingly, the Company anchors stakeholder engagement on the following principles:\na)\n Mat\neriality – Prioritised consideration of the \neconomic, environmental and social impacts \nidentified to be important to the stakeholders as well as the organisation.\nb)\n Compl\neteness – Understanding key concerns of \nstakeholders and their expectations.\nc)\n Responsiv\neness – Responding coherently and \ntransparently to such issues and concerns.\nThe Company has put in place systems and procedures to identify, prioritise and address the needs and concerns of its stakeholders across Businesses and Units in a continuous, consistent and systematic manner. It has implemented mechanisms to facilitate effective dialogues with all stakeholders across Businesses, identify material concerns and their resolution in an equitable and transparent manner. These measures have helped the Company develop strong relationships, which have stood the test of time. Select examples of how stakeholder inputs have been incorporated into ITC’s policies and activities are presented below:\n1. Inv estors: The Company engages extensively with \nthe investor ecosystem i.e. analysts representing institutional equity investors, fund/portfolio managers in top FIIs, Domestic Mutual Funds, FPIs, Private Insurance Companies etc. During the year, more than 200 interactions including meetings, participation in physical and virtual conferences, calls, etc. were undertaken with the investor ecosystem. The Company continues to communicate quarterly performance takeaways through press releases, followed by presentations and post-result calls with analysts. Key highlights of the performance are also being shared \nwith all shareholders by e-mail. The Investors section of the Company’s website is also being updated on an \nongoing basis. The Company is well-recognised for its ESG credentials, and is acknowledged as one of the pioneers of adopting the Triple Bottom Line philosophy in India. Based on requests, the Company engaged on one-on-one basis with ESG specialists of fund houses/brokerages covering, inter alia, progress towards achieving its ambitious Sustainability 2.0 goals by 2030. These initiatives have been much appreciated by the investor ecosystem.\n2. Cus tomers & Value Chain Partners:  Customers, \nConsumers and Value Chain Partners are some of ITC’s core stakeholders. Various tech-enabled avenues have been deployed to constantly receive feedback and ideas from these stakeholders.\nA specialised team, ‘Team Synthesis’, has progressively \nevolved from being a ‘Customer Interactions’ team to a ‘Customer Experience’ team to ‘Stakeholder Experience Team’, and now into a ‘Stakeholder Experience Management Team’. In its current avatar, in addition to keeping customer centricity as the base, SOPs and policies are designed and implemented in such a manner that the experience of all stakeholders is taken into equitable consideration. This has not just helped in achieving better experience for customers as well as the employees but has also made every stakeholder accountable for the team’s and the organisation’s growth. Rapidly evolving consumer needs are constantly being monitored through social listening, in-depth immersions and are being carefully synthesised to transform into relevant solutions. A few key initiatives that demonstrate the above are:\n•\n The entir\ne customer experience process has been \nincentivised for the associates, team leaders as \nwell as for the Quality Analysts (QAs) in such a manner that each month they accumulate points for their monthly performance based on objective parameters like ideation (KAIZEN) and initiatives taken beyond the assigned tasks to improve the process continuously; this provides an enabling environment for them to perform better\n•\n The sc\nenarios related to matters like environment, \nproduct, packaging, ergonomics, and quality engineering, highlighted by customers are answered by respective brand teams, and any new or unique scenario highlighted is shared with the respective stakeholders as a VOC (Voice of Customer)\n3. Community: Some of the examples where inputs \nreceived from stakeholders were incorporated into \ninterventions are mentioned below.REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023Business Responsibility \nand Sustainability Report\nXXIXForming large-scale long-term partnerships with \nGovernment to amplify reach and scale is one of the core tenets of Social Investment Programme’s implementation approach. In this case, stakeholder feedback received through consultations and interactions were appropriately incorporated during renewal/extension of the partnership. During the year, some Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) with government ended and discussions were initiated on what changes and additions need to be considered in the next phase of partnership. Two such examples are shared below:\n•\n Aft\ner completion of first phase of partnership \nwith NITI Aayog for Aspirational Districts \nProgramme, there were detailed deliberations with NITI Aayog, District Administration and Krishi Vigyan Kendras, based on which scope for the second phase of partnership was finalised; it was decided that in this phase, the activities that were directly done by ITC in the first phase now need to be internalised by the Government and ITC should focus primarily on taking up pilots for new emerging areas that will set direction for replication of those models; subsequently, an agreement was done for the second phase partnership incorporating the same covering  \n27 Districts across 8 States\n•\n In As\nsam, ITC was working in the area of  \nMother & Child Health and Nutrition in two districts – Kamrup and Darrang and had successfully demonstrated its approach; in consultation with Department of Women and Child Development, it was decided that there is a need to replicate the approach at a larger scale; accordingly, an MoU was signed with the Department during FY 2022-23 to cover 8 Districts of the State including 7 Aspirational Districts, wherein the Government will replicate the approach with ITC’s knowledge support\n3.\n Pr\novide details of instances of Engagement with, \nand Actions taken to, address the Concerns of Vulnerable/Marginalized Stakeholder Groups.\nITC’s SIP adopts a bottoms-up approach to identify \nand address the emerging needs of the community. Presented hereunder are few instances wherein changing community needs were addressed either through modifications in ongoing programme components or by introducing entirely new interventions.•\n  Liquid W aste Management: Requirement for \nliquid waste management emerged as one of the \npriority areas of community during the Core Area Perspective Plan (CAPP) 2.0 exercise; during the year, ITC had entered into a partnership with the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, through India Sanitation Coalition (ISC), FICCI; under the partnership, ITC aims to create 36 Light House’s Gram Panchayats in various States, under which liquid waste management is one of the major components; these Panchayats are now being assisted to plan solutions like soak pits, and stabilisation ponds, to address liquid waste problem in their areas\n•\n Mobil\ne Medical Units (MMUs): Healthcare emerged \nas another priority area for community during CAPP 2.0 exercise; in order to ensure access and availability of curative and preventive healthcare to rural communities, ITC Swaasth Kiran programme was initiated, wherein Mobile Medical Units were deployed in Saharanpur and Munger districts in collaboration with local Health Department; these MMUs visit the villages and provide doorstep consultation to the rural communities\n•\n Linkages of F\narmers to Social Security Schemes:  \nFarmers being one of the most vulnerable population are prone to social and climatic shocks; hence, building resilience amongst the farmer community is of utmost importance, as it not only provides a cushion against such shocks, but also helps in improving risk taking appetite of farmers; with this view, farmer beneficiaries under the Climate Smart Agriculture programme were linked to six identified government schemes on the basis of needs – PM Kisan, Crop Insurance, Soil Health Card, Kisan Credit Card, Pension Scheme and institutional channels like e-NAM (National Agriculture Market) for selling of produce; over 9.5 lakh linkages with such schemes were enabled during the year benefitting over 3.8 lakh farmers\n•\n Cr\nedit Linkage to Agri-business Centers (ABC): \nAccess to institutional credit emerged as one of the key needs of farmers in Andhra Pradesh as they were otherwise struggling with high interest loans from informal sources; to address the specific need, banking institutions were mobilised and credit linkage of ABCs through banks was planned and executed helping them in availing low interest loansREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023\nBusiness Responsibility \nand Sustainability Report\nXXXBusinesses should respect and promote human rights.\nEssential Indicators\n1.
